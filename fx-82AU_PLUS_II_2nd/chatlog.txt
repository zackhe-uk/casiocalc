mistyre9309: And <byte count>?
mistyre9309: alr
jsaidoru: 0x8D is Ran# + 1(will show @)
mistyre9309: Yeah
jsaidoru: you know how to get unstable bytes?
mistyre9309: can you give me examples as to what I should write in the <0x80> and <byte count>?
jsaidoru: if the calculator tokens contains $ then sure <:kekw:1179085868519133287>
mistyre9309: hmmm
advidiot: noy it means dollars 🤑 🤑 🤑 🤑 /s
jsaidoru: yes
mistyre9309: $ means any number?
jsaidoru: oh i found the 570 vere version
## fx-570/991ES PLUS VerE ROM dump hackstring (using checksum)
by user202729, source: <https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5029670678>
```
<52 characters>

Ans →M 0 $
0 0 $ $
$ $ <byte count>
$ $ $ $
$ $ $ $

³√( →M 0 $
$ $ $ $
$ $ cv02 <0x8D>

cv10 →D 0 $

<12 characters>
```
`<byte count>`: 2 characters representing the number of bytes in data segment 8 (code segment 0) to be subtracted - 1, in little endian. Note that the `0xFFFC` first bytes of data/code segment 1 is still subtracted.

Template hex version:
```
01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 8B 4B 30 01 30 30 01 01 01 01 xx xx 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 A8 4B 30 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 D8 8D E0 4A 30 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
```
mistyre9309: Well, can we translate it?
jsaidoru: 82
mistyre9309: or 82
mistyre9309: This is for the 991 esp?

mistyre9309: Even if it's not finished
mistyre9309: No like, just the hackstring that already works
jsaidoru: the rom dumping is not finished so its kinda impossible to do
mistyre9309: <@1085862271399493732>
jsaidoru: only the segment 0(still not the full segment, they need to extract a huge FF chunk too)
mistyre9309: Oh
advidiot: the text that you have sent seems like hieroglyphics for me
mistyre9309: We have the VerE rom, but not the verf
mistyre9309: Do you know any method to translate the fx 82 au plus II rom dump hackstring to the 991 es plus VerF/VerE?
advidiot: theseat_yt, ilovecats4606 and  mycatismycat
mistyre9309: btw
advidiot: looks like it's actually three people
advidiot: only a part of the rom afaik
mistyre9309: He succeeded, didn't he?
advidiot: kind mister ilovecats#4606 has been trying to dump the rom of this calculator for a while now
hurleyclan_5: this is my home now 💯
hurleyclan_5: thanks
hurleyclan_5: thats the one\
advidiot: just check the media tab in search

hurleyclan_5: do yall have a photo of the calculator this chanell is about
mistyre9309: Can someone convert this to hex? For the image drawing hackstring on the 991esp
mistyre9309: 
canasage: https://tenor.com/view/monster-gif-15735703222063336145
theseat_yt: idk where that is
bn9u: blud is going to agartha
theseat_yt: .___.
ilovecats4606: overseas
theseat_yt: Where are u going
theseat_yt: Ok
ilovecats4606: going overseas
theseat_yt: Why
ilovecats4606: i won’t be available with calc until 2026
theseat_yt: I changed the master prompt so that it doesn’t hallucinate, and its core focus is providing accurate information no matter what.

ChatGPT hallucinates as it is wanting to please the user (as told by openAI), but you can edit grok’s instructions to very greatly reduce the chance of hallucinating.

It is also promoted to not use the internet, and the chat logs instead.  This increases accuracy. If you want to check the validity of any of the references, paste the reference it provided into the chat search in discord, it doesn’t make up or alter messages from what I have seen so far.
theseat_yt: ChatGPT is dumb
theseat_yt: Totalynce is carrying us fr
theseat_yt: I feel I need a way to keep track of my important messages that I need to use
theseat_yt: Check back in the chat and u can check parts if you like
ilovecats4606: and idk if im right
ilovecats4606: like i tried to disassemble the hackstring
ilovecats4606: but like idk how to start a rop chain
ilovecats4606: i sort of understand registeres and some stuff now
ilovecats4606: wait i sorta dont understand and i want <@759251017287860244> to like double check this is right cause i asked chat and it was like half wrong
theseat_yt: Yeah
ilovecats4606: thats smartr
ilovecats4606: wait you gave it the chatlogs
theseat_yt: https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtNA_360a5269-e25e-4c36-807e-432a4dc4a440

this might be of interest
theseat_yt: Also we need to get checksum hackstring and validate the current ROM
theseat_yt: Quite close. We have to 
- extend FF chunk seg0 
- Dump seg1 (need to increment ER14 to point to seg1)
- convert the ROM with pixel detection and extract needed frames
ilovecats4606: how close are we to fullromdump
ilovecats4606: i literally taught u these stuffs and overflows 😭
ilovecats4606: i just need learn asm stuffs and cpu arch
ilovecats4606: bro, i lowk already know
theseat_yt: thank grok
mycatismycat: so yeah, pretty useful
thanks
mycatismycat: i already knew most of that but the overflow part was kind of new
mycatismycat: oh yes that's nice
mycatismycat: cool
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> this might help u understand how the calculator works (guide by grok)
theseat_yt: okay sure
mycatismycat: but what's wrong with logging it again? \:) the more the merrier
mycatismycat: I know you already logged it
theseat_yt: I’m on a holiday so I couldn’t send it i am not near my laptop
theseat_yt: I already logged it :|
mycatismycat: feel free to open a PR if you did it (https://github.com/zackhe-uk/casiocalc/pulls)
mycatismycat: yeah that's a good idea
ilovecats4606: hmm
ilovecats4606: that
ilovecats4606: Reccomendation:

make it scroll bottom up like discord
Maybe make it discordlike ui for easier reading for codeblocks.
I may code something to make it look like
mycatismycat: **NOTE: this is only a text archive and does not include discord-uploaded files or their links**
mycatismycat: https://casiocalc.zackhe.uk/fx-82AU_PLUS_II_2nd/chatlog.txt
i will update this regularly, feel free to use it
mycatismycat: it has to be some of the worst code i've ever written in my life but it does the job
mycatismycat: replace ${auth} with your discord account token
mycatismycat: ```window.msgLog = [];

message scalper for this channel
theseat_yt: I needed it to get the ai to know stuff about the calculator to help get seg1 dump (have not got it yet - im on holidays)
ilovecats4606: hello everyone!!!
ilovecats4606: moyai
theseat_yt: At least in this channel
theseat_yt: Already done (hehehe)
ilovecats4606: someone should log all of the messages
mycatismycat: https://casiocalc.zackhe.uk/fx-82AU_PLUS_II_2nd/seg0_uptoFF.bin
mirror of theSEAT's seg0 incase casio ever bans this server
mycatismycat: we will never get seg 1
mycatismycat: indeed
theseat_yt: Dead chat
mycatismycat: oh ok
theseat_yt: The old hackstring I was talking abt
theseat_yt: Na
mycatismycat: no fucking way the ai that called themselves mechah*tler online is that smart
mycatismycat: wait it actually worked??
theseat_yt: welp the hackstring worked tho
theseat_yt: my dumb a** forgot to change the thing that grok told me to 😭😭😭😭😭😭
theseat_yt: https://theseat.yt/html/CalcConverter
Here is a converter that I (chatGPT) made
theseat_yt: Best token table out of all of them :P
theseat_yt: chatgpt forgor a 0
ilovecats4606: hackstring too short or u didn’t overflow right
theseat_yt: fricking syntax error
theseat_yt: my calc went off but im doing it again now
theseat_yt: thx
ilovecats4606: nice

ilovecats4606: please

ilovecats4606: so we dumped seg0
whoisthat2009guy: great
whoisthat2009guy: dead chat
theseat_yt: ??
mycatismycat: I could spend my life pondering upon the contents of that message... OR I could go outside and touch grass
mycatismycat: one message in fx 82AU PLUS II 2nd edition channel i didn't read, that got deleted
theseat_yt: I forgot abt that
theseat_yt: Yea
mycatismycat: just one last segment
theseat_yt: Basically the full rom
mycatismycat: well not the full ROM
theseat_yt: Gn everyone
theseat_yt: Gotta go to bed now
theseat_yt: It is, but without the FF chunk
theseat_yt: I have to go to bed
theseat_yt: Yah
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244>
jsaidoru: this is the rom?
theseat_yt: I’d say that it is very accurate
theseat_yt: Yea
mycatismycat: all these strings make me wonder how you could trigger them
theseat_yt: <@802070813112926229> we have got the rom :P
mycatismycat: I NEED TO KNOW THIS
mycatismycat: PING ME GOD DAMN IT
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664>
ilovecats4606: have it
ilovecats4606: yeah
theseat_yt: for what
jsaidoru: has anyone made an interface and model.lua for this
theseat_yt: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XV5AhI5UUdx1MwY2dXYpvo1HTxv-MXJe/view?usp=drive_link
ilovecats4606: write programs
ilovecats4606: 4linespelling
ilovecats4606: understand how it works
theseat_yt: And what can we do after we get the ROM?
theseat_yt: Why are we even dumping the ROM in the first place?
theseat_yt: I’ll get a 100% accurate seg1 dump when I get home (excluding the FF chunk)
ilovecats4606: can you do it for fx82auplusii2nd
frsr: i will put 3 hours into automating something that would only take me 1 hour
theseat_yt: Maybe an hour
theseat_yt: Doing it manually would only take abt half an hour
theseat_yt: I made it automatic but the video was a low fps so it didn’t work as well as I hoped
frsr: you'll need to do half frames as you've said
frsr: so i captured a full frame during that
frsr: the hackstring i wrote there's a  gap where no pixels change
frsr: my code will need changed a bit
your top bottom idea is good
but doing it manually would be hell
theseat_yt: But your code is probably much better
theseat_yt: So my idea was we advance to the next frame and if the line is in the top or bottom half the user could just press a key and save the other half
theseat_yt: More accurately
ilovecats4606: tysm
frsr: since the values need tuned, it's signal processing stuff
frsr: i'll give it a run in a bit when i get out of bed
frsr: firmware/video_dump/timing_recovery.py
frsr: i do indeed, in the github i sent
ilovecats4606: do you have framecutter
ilovecats4606: theres this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T2bawc0ALsp5bBAt5g1GI679GCuX5QlS/view?usp=sharing and this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8G0jA9-ZqERFYj7qu4CR469am_Ur-88/view both seg0 same thing
ilovecats4606: so we got the hackstring and the video
frsr: and this is interesting
frsr: i don't check here as often as i should
frsr: please do feel free to ping me btw
frsr: https://github.com/fxesdev/fx-83GT_Plus

frsr: and in a github
frsr: but i documented all my stuff here
frsr: i'll try where i can
ilovecats4606: pls help 🙏
frsr: why
frsr: manual frame saving??
frsr: how're you doing the frame timing recovery?
frsr: i did the same for the 83 GT plus
frsr: hell yeah!
frsr: you're dumping the ROM via the screen?
ilovecats4606: besides i catn get the tangle and lightign right
ilovecats4606: it give me ptsd
ilovecats4606: i am NOT entering gthat hackstring bro
ilovecats4606: yes
theseat_yt: Move onto a bench
theseat_yt: Making it move slightly
theseat_yt: And the weight compresses over the span of the video
theseat_yt: You are filming on carpet
theseat_yt: Tomorrow cuz it’s getting late
theseat_yt: Ima try the hackstring myself
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> did u use AF lock?

ilovecats4606: You will have to deal with this sorry
ilovecats4606: i dont know how to fix it
ilovecats4606: its still drifting slightly
ilovecats4606: worth of seg0
ilovecats4606: i recorded 11 minutes
ilovecats4606: Ok
ilovecats4606: it should NOT move
ilovecats4606: ok i have a cup on my phone
ilovecats4606: hmmm
ilovecats4606: i might rerecorfd
ilovecats4606: actually its still playing
ilovecats4606: you get these 2 vids
ilovecats4606: i am NOT rerecording
ilovecats4606: WTH
ilovecats4606: IN THE VIDEO
ilovecats4606: SLOWLY DRIFTING
ilovecats4606: IS LIKE
ilovecats4606: MY PHONE
ilovecats4606: YO
ilovecats4606: forgot to remove audio
ilovecats4606: oops
ilovecats4606: i will send a video, but the calculator will play the rom until ii turn it off. So if it doenst look alright for your program, let me know so i dont have to reypte the whole thing
ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> I need you online
ilovecats4606: YESS IT WORKED
ilovecats4606: @@
ilovecats4606: ok i am typing the FF bit
ilovecats4606: 2 times i made this mistake
ilovecats4606: 🤦
ilovecats4606: 6 BYTES
ilovecats4606: LIKE
ilovecats4606: I SAW `e` AND I SKIPPED
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: WHY SYNTAXERROR
ilovecats4606: I FOUNDOUT
ilovecats4606: GUYS
theseat_yt: just add FF's until it is gud ;)
theseat_yt: oh wait we could just bruteforce the FF length
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: there is a chance that it is different tho
ilovecats4606: maybe same
ilovecats4606: look emurom
theseat_yt: also we have to figure out how to get the FF block correct
ilovecats4606: nice
theseat_yt: also I got my calculator home
theseat_yt: good luck
ilovecats4606: i overflow and do hs correct
ilovecats4606: why syntax error?
whoisthat2009guy: good luck ig
ilovecats4606: i will try 1 more time
theseat_yt: for 100% acc we have to:
- Get a video without AF
- Edit the cleaner to allow manual frame saving (not too hard)
- manually go through every frame
- Rom dump seg 1
- do it again
whoisthat2009guy: only some of esp calc dumped
theseat_yt: thats not many
whoisthat2009guy: with 100% accuracy, checksum is also ok
whoisthat2009guy: 570esp (2nd), 570vnp (2nd)
whoisthat2009guy: yes
theseat_yt: has any calculator had the rom fully dumped with 100% accuracy before?
whoisthat2009guy: but time to dump ... too much
whoisthat2009guy: well, dump each byte is way more correct
whoisthat2009guy: because a **single** byte error may cause rom not working as expected
whoisthat2009guy: the rom must be 100% correct
whoisthat2009guy: but the matter is
whoisthat2009guy: yes
theseat_yt: its not gonna be 100% perfect
whoisthat2009guy: and gave me long , long time ago
whoisthat2009guy: because I had template of checksum hackstring (chinese created it)
ilovecats4606: maybe i will fix syntaxerror
ilovecats4606: just use me
whoisthat2009guy: well, if I have at least 1 au 2nd calc i can do it myself
whoisthat2009guy: it will be correct if you can **use checksum** hackstring to calculate and check
bn9u: so inc er14
bn9u: iirc it uses the r0 = 1:[er14]
bn9u: it is simpler iirc
bn9u: i think its pretty simple to change to get seg 1,
bn9u: yes
theseat_yt: I’m assuming we dump seg 1
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> we have seg0, what do we do from here?
theseat_yt: Probs
jsaidoru: if theres only one big block of ff maybe you can pad it until it reaches 128 kb? 76.77 sounds very odd
theseat_yt: Yea
ilovecats4606: debugging
ilovecats4606: that is in emurom aswell
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: See here
theseat_yt: I don’t think so, you could do the maths and get a rough estimate or just use the amount of ff characters from an existing rom
jsaidoru: can it be fixed
theseat_yt: It isn’t visually updating so my program cannot detect the updating line
theseat_yt: There is a big block of ff characters in the middle where it is all just on
jsaidoru: also wdym by not detecting FF
theseat_yt: Mhm
jsaidoru: 
theseat_yt: DISCLAIMER: 
- This ROM extraction is __NOT__ 100% accurate!
- I estimate the accuracy to be ~about 80-95%
- The way that my program cleaned it made the FF (or ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ)  not be detected
theseat_yt: SEGMENT 0 EXTRACTION
theseat_yt: The way that my program cleaned it made the FF (or ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ)  not be detected
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244>
theseat_yt: sent the wrong code for the last one sorry 😅
theseat_yt: not typo
theseat_yt: mhm
mycatismycat: sand 🔥
theseat_yt: For more accurate results
theseat_yt: Just that we need a video without af
theseat_yt: I mean, I already did
theseat_yt: Sand undertale reference!!11!1!!1!1!11!11!1!
mycatismycat: i would do it manually
mycatismycat: get somebody else to do it
mycatismycat: no i'm too stupid
ilovecats4606: make the vid interpreter
mycatismycat: knowing that one day... there will be an fx-82AU PLUS II 2nd edition ROMdump... it fills you with determination
theseat_yt: you would just check which is the lowest row that has changed pixels from the last frame
theseat_yt: it wouldnt be too hard to make a script that extracts the data
ilovecats4606: Now what totalaynce said makes sens
ilovecats4606: when i look at the video slowly, it looks very hard to do, because the display is still fading out the bottom rows (i think the contorller has  already sent to display, its just fading) but the top row is already starting to fade change. So having 1 single frame for 1 bit of rom is not possible
mycatismycat: ahh ok
theseat_yt: padding i think
mycatismycat: what do you mean by `= pad`
theseat_yt: oka
ilovecats4606: i will do it later maybe
ilovecats4606: freeai
theseat_yt: you can edit it to detect the centre, but it would be more reliable to have a video where it dosent focus or move it at all.
theseat_yt: the program is very sensitive, ill send u the code
ilovecats4606: it should be close enough
ilovecats4606: just take colpour info from the middle of the pixel
ilovecats4606: This is how this rom seg 0 dump work:
```
- Jump SP to label "loop"
- Set ER0 = 0xA001 and ER2 = 0x0099
- Copy R0 to R2 -> this time ER2 = 0x0001
- Increment source (actually ER2 increases first and store to [ER8] after that)
- Store R2 to where it contains 2E 88
- Set ER2 = 0xA030
- Set EA = 0xFFFF (source), ER4 = pad, ER0 = ER2 = 2E 1F, ER8 = pad
- Read from rom segment 0
- Set ER0 = address contained 2E 88
- Load to ER8
- Store R2 to ER8
- Render and jump back to 0x8BB6
```
we need an alternative method
to instead of using l er8, [er0], we use that "alternative" method, we just need to replace ER8 directly instead of loading from [er0]
theseat_yt: We have the hackstring for sector 0, we have the program to dump it we just need a video of it that doesn’t autofocus and mess it up
theseat_yt: Almost
user11111110301: Has the rom been dumped for this model?
user11111110301: I made some interesting rops
user11111110301: Ooh
theseat_yt: You will have to ask <@981463678698266664> and <@759251017287860244> as they made the hackstring, I have not been told how they made it.
user11111110301: You you only posted the hack string
theseat_yt: Wdym
user11111110301: Does anyone know how to loop and restore the stack?
user11111110301: What of it Rop code?
theseat_yt: ty!
whoisthat2009guy: okay so thats it lol
whoisthat2009guy: wait my bad.
theseat_yt: true
theseat_yt: ohh okay
whoisthat2009guy: 1.
a. Yes
b. At 44th characters
c. No need after we typed 100 chars full

2. Because it's equal to 0x100 - easier to calculate byte and to dump.
theseat_yt: thx
ilovecats4606: 1. `9999|A=0` start typing it overwrite the a=0
a. yes
b.?
c.?
2.idk
theseat_yt: for the single screen dumps, we did it from 144 bytes
jsaidoru: the hackstring probably starts right after the overflow (A=0, then you enter 91 or something bytes, then you enter the hackstring)
jsaidoru: he definitely use unstable chars
and from the romdump video he didnt add padding
theseat_yt: ye
jsaidoru: especially the second one
jsaidoru: interesting
theseat_yt: 1. How do you enter the hackstring? 
    a. Do you get the characters from unstable?
    b. Where does the hackstring start?
    c. do you add padding to M?
2. Why does it only show 256 bytes at a time, when the screen can display 372 (is this bc 2^8 is closest?)
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> I have a few questions about the hackstring
ilovecats4606: just use sign in with github
ilovecats4606: you dont need
ilovecats4606: wtf?
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: emu.ca510.com
mistyre9309: Yo dude can you give me an invitation code

whoisthat2009guy: bruh
ilovecats4606: 0,1
theseat_yt: how many segments are there?
ilovecats4606: seg0
theseat_yt: so close
theseat_yt: then I will use my program to get ROM then i will make a program to clean up the binary then we get fx-82 au plus II 2nd edition rom
ilovecats4606: do it later
ilovecats4606: that means i have to retype hackstring
ilovecats4606: .....
theseat_yt: U got all that?
theseat_yt: also go to settings > camera > Lock camera
theseat_yt: just hold instead
theseat_yt: like you would tap to focus
theseat_yt: then hold down the screen untill it says AE/AF lock
theseat_yt: point it at the calculator
theseat_yt: so when you are taking a video
theseat_yt: okay
ilovecats4606: no
theseat_yt: is it jailbroken?
ilovecats4606: how turn off af in iphone cam
theseat_yt: it seems likely that the camera automatically focused.
theseat_yt: (here is an image with only the movement)
theseat_yt: Here is an image difference from an early frame to an ending frame (canvas is blacked out), the green and the red show the differences.
theseat_yt: it did
ilovecats4606: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8G0jA9-ZqERFYj7qu4CR469am_Ur-88/view
ilovecats4606: i think you lowk got the wrong vid cause my vid no sound
ilovecats4606: my camera doesnt move ??
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> Would you be available to take a better video (one where the camera dosent move) as I left my calculator at school?
theseat_yt: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1246407895/embed
This is a visual replay of the results, as we can see it gets distorted near the end
theseat_yt: read my message it explains a lot
theseat_yt: yeah, some bytes are captured as they change which messes it up
ilovecats4606: <@705043446284419104>
ilovecats4606: can’t solve at ur ss is repeated
ilovecats4606: hmm looks a bit wrong
theseat_yt: `Auto Power Off Current: 10(Min`
theseat_yt: It takes multiple copies so if you could use that to increase accuracy
theseat_yt: Gtg it’s dinner
theseat_yt: and write a script to remove the padding where the screen dosent update
theseat_yt: also I would like to add that it did recapture some of the information more than once, you could write a script to clean it if u wanted
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> <@759251017287860244> Here is my attempt at getting the fx-82 au plus II 2nd edition RAM off of the screen, as the video progresses the calculator or camera moves slightly so the binary gets ever so slightly more corrupt as you go on, as well as having the padding binary every frame. I'd say the dump is roughly 95% accurate at the start and about 70-80% accurate towards the end.
theseat_yt: 'Bin Oct Dec Hex' i found
theseat_yt: but as you can see it is not perfect
theseat_yt: you can see some of the code
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> Here is the .bin file:
ilovecats4606: M3 isint too bad
ilovecats4606: i can run on mine
ilovecats4606: what cpu you got?
theseat_yt: Might optimise the multi-threading but too late now ig
theseat_yt: Very inefficient
theseat_yt: Total time of about 50 minutes to process the whole video
theseat_yt: Video processing is about halfway
theseat_yt: It detects it every 15 frames (for optimisation) but is adjustable
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> progress report
ilovecats4606: aa

theseat_yt: sure
ilovecats4606: lmk when u done
ilovecats4606: ok

ilovecats4606: but i seem not able to type too many unstable with 2020 method (maybe no more than 2) so i wait for spelling method to drop
whoisthat2009guy: it will display actual ascii characters instead of tokens (the one that you saw on the input screen)
whoisthat2009guy: third column is only use for spelling
theseat_yt: Also new free calculator acquired
theseat_yt: Also why notes next to the character??
theseat_yt: What’s the point of the third column
mycatismycat: https://github.com/ilovecats4606/fx-82AU-PLUS-II-2nd/blob/main/tokentable.md

angusbromly: fuck off with this shit
lbphacker: is that right?

lbphacker: yeah makes sense
ilovecats4606: i will write better guide in english
jsaidoru: just use google translate bruh
ilovecats4606: i write english
ilovecats4606: not viet bro 😭
ilovecats4606: xue hua piao piao
jsaidoru: wrote a small guide
jsaidoru: so basically basic overflow
jsaidoru: oh you do it before typing the hackstring
ilovecats4606: i am not recording typing for 30 min
jsaidoru: i didnt see this step in the video <:thonk:1179086058856648815>
ilovecats4606: yes
ilovecats4606: idk
ilovecats4606: DAMN WHAT
jsaidoru: also this is segement 0 right?
jsaidoru: whats a last chance
jsaidoru: DAMN WHAT
ilovecats4606: go to `9999999|A=0` type it then [ac] [left] [equals]

whoisthat2009guy: <@981463678698266664> hmm, should we release hackstring now?
whoisthat2009guy: mean use each half of frame and merge to 1 img
whoisthat2009guy: stevey tool uses manual frame cutting method
whoisthat2009guy: i need frame cutter
ilovecats4606: i will make one later but i got some stuff to do
ilovecats4606: 🙄
ilovecats4606: if its so easy why dont u make it
theseat_yt: just make a script bru
ilovecats4606: *mov
ilovecats4606: no compression
ilovecats4606: i can upload the file from my phone as like .ppt or smt and u change the extension to mp4
theseat_yt: bro just use my tool, its a lot more reliable than img2bin
its also very reliable as well
kribit: looks like some great progress
kribit: holy what did i miss
whoisthat2009guy: i need a frame cutter. stevey had a frame cutter tool be4 but i lost 😭
whoisthat2009guy: hmm
ilovecats4606: 1. chatgpt code in pinned also there is original img2bin
2. needs steady lighting like mine
mycatismycat: 🔥 🔥
angusbromly: p frames will not work because the rom is moving
angusbromly: in good conditions it seems to work but it is very difficult to do for a video because how the way compression works
lbphacker: do yall have a solution that mostly works or is this a genuine problem still
lbphacker: mainly because the one time I saw it done it seemed to work smoothly enough
lbphacker: I thought reading bits off the screen was a solved problem in this community
angusbromly: sadly the screen is damaged
whoisthat2009guy: for easier analysing I want a guy who had a good -> best camera like you
whoisthat2009guy: your camera looks.... GREAT
angusbromly: even the slightest gradient
angusbromly: 
angusbromly: 
angusbromly: a video will be near impossible

angusbromly: i got my hands on a fx82auplusii2nd today actually
angusbromly: yes sir
ilovecats4606: enjoy some fx82auplusii2nd romdump ig
ilovecats4606: mhm
angusbromly: okay
ilovecats4606: make pyton script
ilovecats4606: yes
ilovecats4606: will give
ilovecats4606: yes
angusbromly: we need the hackstring 🤣
angusbromly: processing gonna be hard

jsaidoru: nope im not interested in models that isnt classwiz x
ilovecats4606: r u good with hackstring
jsaidoru: thought its just some screen issue
jsaidoru: hmm i saw that
ilovecats4606: notice how some parts of the screen arent mving
ilovecats4606: .
ilovecats4606: look at this video
jsaidoru: so the bytes arent 100% accurate?
ilovecats4606: random bytes, and the rom hackstring is half working
mycatismycat: DUMP IT
mycatismycat: FREEROM
jsaidoru: btw what parts of the rom were dumped?
whoisthat2009guy: some bytes we dumped (from address `0x3402`)

ilovecats4606: MOMENT OF TRUTH.. DOES ROMDUMP WORK
ilovecats4606: https://github.com/ilovecats4606/fx-82AU-PLUS-II-2nd/blob/main/tokentranslator.py
ilovecats4606: its not gonna do i anything
ilovecats4606: a hackstring bro
ilovecats4606: its not
theseat_yt: cuz I have too much free time
theseat_yt: ima test it
ilovecats4606: nono
theseat_yt: is that hackstring?
ilovecats4606: because of unstable
ilovecats4606: NEVERMIND its fine
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: 93 b8 21 b9
ilovecats4606: if you type it with button
ilovecats4606: but
ilovecats4606: if you type `93` in hex manually it gives 10^(
ilovecats4606: i just realised
ilovecats4606: bro
ilovecats4606: full thing released soon
ilovecats4606: dont worry
theseat_yt: why tho
theseat_yt: :(
ilovecats4606: :d
ilovecats4606: private for now
ilovecats4606: shh
theseat_yt: Hackstring pls

theseat_yt: :OOOO
mycatismycat: And it's not even the 82au
mycatismycat: That's crazy
mycatismycat: You can't trust clankers
ilovecats4606: Will just make my own pythonlater
ilovecats4606: asked it to translate hex to character. Stupid bot
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: update:: chatgpt is SCAMMER
ilovecats4606: theres about 67 unstables bro

whoisthat2009guy: 
ilovecats4606: how is this even allowed 😭
ilovecats4606: dude its basically asking the teacher "did i get it right" its so op
ilovecats4606: 
angusbromly: depends on the exam
ilovecats4606: like you can literally check if ur ans is right during exams and stuff
ilovecats4606: imo VERIFY funct is super op in this calc, its basically cheating
ilovecats4606: olo
whoisthat2009guy: lol
ilovecats4606: bro just repleid and gave credit 😭
ilovecats4606: i dont need credit
mycatismycat: well he didn't credit anyone for it
ilovecats4606: when bro claim as their own 😭
angusbromly: multiple people have joined from that post
angusbromly: theif?? i never clamed it as my own in just tryna get more people to help
angusbromly: 🤣 yea thats me
mycatismycat: lol
mycatismycat: at least wait a month next time
mycatismycat: 4 days here and he already stole your work and posted it as his
mycatismycat: what a blatent ahh thief
mycatismycat: oh damn
ilovecats4606: Also, picture here same as reddit
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: they stated in this server -their name is the same as the reddit
ilovecats4606: i know its indodapro
mycatismycat: seems like bs to me
mycatismycat: they just joined like 4 days ago
mycatismycat: are you sure it's indodapro
ilovecats4606: its u

theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: uhh
ilovecats4606: but its based off hte
ilovecats4606: totalyance hasnt made it yet
ilovecats4606: idk
ilovecats4606: uh
ilovecats4606: oh
theseat_yt: (the slow 9 hour one)

theseat_yt: HERE
ilovecats4606: what
ilovecats4606: h
theseat_yt: just click on the reply
theseat_yt: bruhhhhh
ilovecats4606: yes confirm your statement
ilovecats4606: yes?
ilovecats4606: is?
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: what does that mean
ilovecats4606: each time unstable byte loops is loops byte next to it ???
ilovecats4606: huh
theseat_yt: see the reply
ilovecats4606: next to it?
ilovecats4606: it loops the byte?
ilovecats4606: wdym
theseat_yt: what is it then?
ilovecats4606: yep
theseat_yt: on calc
theseat_yt: yeah, each time unstable byte loops is loops byte next to it
angusbromly: im making a google doc to gather all the info cos it can be hard to find pinned messages
angusbromly: and what is the ^ and down on the top bar of the lcd?
angusbromly: the ->D-00%%
ilovecats4606: thats what hackstring is for
angusbromly: and is there a way to run found gadgets?
angusbromly: i cant find it 😭
ilovecats4606: and people just extract it and you can use in emulators
ilovecats4606: but its quite similar
ilovecats4606: to realrom
ilovecats4606: its a different rom
ilovecats4606: yk how casio provides the calculator emulator
ilovecats4606: emulator rom
angusbromly: wait so if an emulator exists dosnet thay mean the rom is already there?
ilovecats4606: lol ok
angusbromly: no🤣
ilovecats4606: you should go through emurom and try to find gadgets to make loop
ilovecats4606: are you good at asm
angusbromly: oh 😭
ilovecats4606: its a 2byte counter
ilovecats4606: no
angusbromly: like if it counts up with each cursor flash, will it eventually fill ram?
ilovecats4606: i dont get it 😭
angusbromly: like if its just counting
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: like `0100`
ilovecats4606: wdym
ilovecats4606: just left?
ilovecats4606: fx82auplusii2ndrealromemu
angusbromly: what if it is just left? will it crash it?
angusbromly: what emulator is that?
angusbromly: oh nice
ilovecats4606: Think of it as seconds and minutes
ilovecats4606: Here's the unstable byte in memory (im not in an overflow state right now but it doenst matter)

When I change the first bye to FD, it eventually goes to FF, then it increments the second byte to 01 and reset the first one back to 00
angusbromly: alr
angusbromly: what does it do?
ilovecats4606: give me a sec
ilovecats4606: hmm i will visualise it for you
ilovecats4606: yeah its a 2byte counter
angusbromly: that will stay the same
angusbromly: at a certain point it will make a letter infront
ilovecats4606: yeah wdym by copy
ilovecats4606: btw if you want to dump some segmenets of ram make sure to take clear image like this
angusbromly: the unstable character
ilovecats4606: wdym with the unstable
angusbromly: oh
angusbromly: does the top bar mean anything?
ilovecats4606: Also, if you want to find true address, make sure to subtract 0x0c from the address because of the indicator bar
ilovecats4606: its why we want to make a loop
ilovecats4606: yes and it only dumps 372bytes
kribit: holy peak
ilovecats4606: i forgor
ilovecats4606: need ss
angusbromly: its a python one tkinter
angusbromly: okay i will when i get home
ilovecats4606: send a screenshot of which one it is?
ilovecats4606: Its either topleft topright bottomright bottom left or topleft and bottomright
angusbromly: like it runs and that but how do i select the corners?
ilovecats4606: what r u doing
angusbromly: i cant get this to work
ilovecats4606: then sned it here and i can interprest
ilovecats4606: yep so now you take a very good picture with ur phoen that has even lighting and like no pixel shadow
angusbromly: in that case idk
angusbromly: oh mb
silvazwastaken: 😭
angusbromly: thw dump comes from overflow
silvazwastaken: my calc isnt 82au either
angusbromly: yeah but the first but is iverflow
angusbromly: idk about the dump tho
silvazwastaken: isnt that for rom dump
angusbromly: this should work for the first part anyways
angusbromly: <@944220269432672277>
angusbromly: // dump 😅
angusbromly: 
angusbromly: jeez thats a long process
angusbromly: so %% is the address?
angusbromly: ive rewired button on this calc before so its possible to automate some of the long sequences for dumping
angusbromly: 
angusbromly: 
ilovecats4606: ok
angusbromly: ill try this
ilovecats4606: https://github.com/ilovecats4606/fx-82AU-PLUS-II-2nd/blob/main/tokentable.md
angusbromly: ooh
ilovecats4606: .
ilovecats4606: want tutorail?
ilovecats4606: you can overflow
ilovecats4606: yes
angusbromly: as in like type symbols from the table
angusbromly: have you managed to get arbitrary symbols?
ilovecats4606: wahts up
ilovecats4606: yes
angusbromly: is this active?
angusbromly: hello
ilovecats4606: if you just need illegal variable do the pol exploit
ilovecats4606: video
mycatismycat: i suck
mycatismycat: i tested it and it didn't work
ilovecats4606: ?
mycatismycat: ok i'm testing this
ilovecats4606: if you dont see STAT or 0 in bottom right you did it too early
ilovecats4606: If you see 0 in bottom right and theres no reg, you did it too late
mycatismycat: ok
ilovecats4606: reset the calc. Press mode 2, then press ac and about 0.5 secs later press on
mycatismycat: unless i do it as intended by casio
mycatismycat: i just can't get reg to appear
ilovecats4606: why inveretg
ilovecats4606: =0Ref(0mn
ilovecats4606: and like
ilovecats4606: what is 2020=020202
ilovecats4606: x10ans is so glitch
ilovecats4606: why??
ilovecats4606: how?
ilovecats4606: yes
ilovecats4606: video
mycatismycat: it could be a mega skill issue
mycatismycat: i failed
mycatismycat: i tried it
casiotester2k12: 4 line spell (with timer ig) AND inverted syntax error😱
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: i will send the rom
whoisthat2009guy: yes , i think i could help
ilovecats4606: i can send you the emurom
ilovecats4606: if you want to help 😉 go ahead
ilovecats4606: and try to get gadgets
ilovecats4606: I think the way totalyance do it is to find some gadgets in emurom, subtract offset magic number, tell me to dump that addr, then we see if its there
whoisthat2009guy: it can dump seg1 very good
whoisthat2009guy: because I took murasamemru wind's checksum dump hackstring to create a new one
whoisthat2009guy: i was thinking about checksum dumping
ilovecats4606: brr
ilovecats4606: totalyance said that we should try and make a new hackstring
whoisthat2009guy: but analyze px is pain
ilovecats4606: and crash 🤡
ilovecats4606: so i entered the hackstring (it took 30mins to type)
ilovecats4606: Totalyance said: 115esp2 rom thread can help
whoisthat2009guy: only took ~3 minutes to record
whoisthat2009guy: swipe dumping is way faster
ilovecats4606: yes
whoisthat2009guy: but problem is ... offset
whoisthat2009guy: **copy** the template and make hackstring 😂
ilovecats4606: but then i dont understand what gadget
whoisthat2009guy: i think a fastest way for me to do is...
ilovecats4606: Because i know how to dump segments and disassemble to asm
ilovecats4606: thats why i want someone to help or teach me assembly
ilovecats4606: totalyance is busy with exams
ilovecats4606: idk bro
whoisthat2009guy: but... is 4.5hours still a long time?
whoisthat2009guy: dont dump 1byte/s because it's **fcking** costing your time
ilovecats4606: you can check the stuff in pinned of the disassembled stuff we found
ilovecats4606: because 9hours is too long
ilovecats4606: totalyance can make loop of 1byte/sec (9hours) but he said he will try to find 4.5hour method
ilovecats4606: i dump 372bytes at a time
whoisthat2009guy: hmm, 0:0000 to 0:7ffe success?
ilovecats4606: already done
whoisthat2009guy: the best thing we can do is at least do romwindow dumping, because it's the decent way to find some gadget like spelling, etc
whoisthat2009guy: cool
ilovecats4606: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y890iZsUOBc
ilovecats4606: read this
mycatismycat: I can get 5:Reg to show if I use option 2 in the mode and press AC but I have a feeling it's not the way it's meant to happen
mycatismycat: how to get into stat submode 0, i tried it and it didn't work lol
ilovecats4606: 20 offset 5 spam 67 ac lefft equal
ilovecats4606: lets go
ilovecats4606: yep reproducable
ilovecats4606: le me try and reproduce this
ilovecats4606: yooo
ilovecats4606: new strat unlcok
ilovecats4606: I did 9999|A=0 then i type `20` 5 times and spammed 67
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: I KNOW HOW 2020 WORKS NOW
ilovecats4606: HOLYYY
ilovecats4606: I GOT IT
ilovecats4606: YES
ilovecats4606: YES
ilovecats4606: YES
mycatismycat: i can't escape it
mycatismycat: it's everywhere... that number
mycatismycat: god help me
ilovecats4606: offset 20 = 13 and offset 67 = 23
ilovecats4606: I can get this
ilovecats4606: I guess there will just be 2 numbers that are 2020
ilovecats4606: nope
ilovecats4606: hmm
ilovecats4606: i think the 2020 bit at the end overflow will depend whats being displayed
ilovecats4606: let me test a theory
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: hmm 24 doesnt seem to work
ilovecats4606: hmm let me try 24
ilovecats4606: hmm
ilovecats4606: 23 works and i get 2020 at the end lower
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: i did 25 and it shows 7202020 top line and everything else 20
ilovecats4606: this will be it
ilovecats4606: hopefully
ilovecats4606: 67=25
ilovecats4606: ok now i have 202020 last row ending
ilovecats4606: ofset 20-13
67=22
ilovecats4606: 13
ilovecats4606: maybe offset more?
ilovecats4606: hmm
ilovecats4606: hmm interesting it displays 20202067.. top line and bottom is 20 last
ilovecats4606: and 67=21
ilovecats4606: ill try OFFSET 20=16
ilovecats4606: yayyy
ilovecats4606: IT WORKED
ilovecats4606: i will do offset 20 19
ilovecats4606: maybe its before??/
ilovecats4606: i tried increase 67 to 22 and 23 and it disaplys the same thing wtf
ilovecats4606: OFFSET 20 = 20
OFFSET 67 = 21
ilovecats4606: by doing spelling on the cal
ilovecats4606: with the calc
ilovecats4606: diddy blud video
ilovecats4606: hmm right now i am trying to make the
mycatismycat: alright
ilovecats4606: feel free to pr
mycatismycat: this bit kind of looks ugly when parsed by markdown
ilovecats4606: maybe i will do chars when i have time
ilovecats4606: i finished it today the tokens
mycatismycat: Let's go
kribit: https://tenor.com/view/fade-away-oooooooooooo-aga-emoji-crumble-gif-20008708
ilovecats4606: bro
ilovecats4606: 9 hours
ilovecats4606: doing
ilovecats4606: im not
kribit: if your quite close just do
ilovecats4606: the 9 hour method
ilovecats4606: we already have the slow method
kribit: yeah
ilovecats4606: we are quite close
ilovecats4606: the romdump??
ilovecats4606: what
kribit: blud its not gonna happen
ilovecats4606: maybe totalyance will help dump rom so i can get merry christmas in time for christmas
ilovecats4606: 2020 is stupid
ilovecats4606: this calc is stupid
ilovecats4606: I can only spell 3 letters but i can do 3lines spelling numbers
ilovecats4606: I cant get spelling to work
kribit: hallomeen
jsaidoru: hmmm weird
ilovecats4606: ok so usually if i have `123` and i put my cursor at `1|23` and type `1` it become `1123`
For insert mode i would expect it to be `113` but it doesnt do that, it doest the same as normal?
ilovecats4606: it doesnt work
ilovecats4606: overtype mode?
jsaidoru: enter insert mode, when you are on the normal mode then when you enter a key then the key is inserted and everything after it will be shifted
but in insert mode it overwrites instead of shift everything
idk how to explain it

working on fx82au plus ii 2nd table
ilovecats4606: Spelling things
The bottom row is starting from byte 41 inclusive (type `20` 20 times and then 16 bytes). For some reason I cant get more than 2 letters together (I can get 202020AB but 202020ABC will ramdump)
ilovecats4606: https://youtu.be/jPPNtEgKTs0
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: shift del
kribit: what ins key
ilovecats4606: what does the ins key do
mycatismycat: what is this channel
theseat_yt: if I just had the hackstring I would definetly do it
theseat_yt: i have the storage space and time
theseat_yt: easily
theseat_yt: I'd do it for 9 hours
ilovecats4606: as in im not having a camera on for 9 hours
theseat_yt: put it on some books??
ilovecats4606: bc im not pointing a camera for 9 hours
theseat_yt: Then why haven’t we done it
ilovecats4606: yes
theseat_yt: is that true <@981463678698266664>
theseat_yt: grok is that true
ilovecats4606: <ad dr> dump 372 byte
jsaidoru: hmm can it dump an entire segment or just a small part
ilovecats4606: .
ilovecats4606: .

ilovecats4606: If you press [del] after ac left you will enter diag
ilovecats4606: weird glitchy thingy
Obtain a SpecialBox in mathio comp
type in it: x6[frac] x4[right] x4[del]. Fraction with lineio fraction symbol in numerator will appear next to specialbox
[left] [9] [del] [right] [right] [del] [left] [)] [=] Syntax error
[left] you will see crazy fraction. x3[right] [3] [left] [del]. Calc will freeze for a sec then go weird blank screen with 2 arrows and M light up. If you press [ac] [left] weird things come up in equation
whoisthat2009guy: 
whoisthat2009guy: actually stevey decomped it before that's why i'm not writing it down 😂
ilovecats4606: dm ?
hoang_phuc1234: i dont have the emu ROM tho
ilovecats4606: then tell me addr
ilovecats4606: find it in the emurom

theseat_yt: wow
mycatismycat: And I also actively view this channel
mycatismycat: Not in this channel though, in <#1133693577663369246>
mycatismycat: I have contributed a small hackstring
theseat_yt: I love how <@802070813112926229>'s name is that, yet they have never sent a message in this channel LMAO
theseat_yt: but it works, and I can see the voltage based off of the brightness of an LED
theseat_yt: i was tired then
theseat_yt: yeah it is lol
sus02965: i used to play with those so much as a kid...
theseat_yt: yeah
sus02965: are those Snap Circuits
bn9u: Busy with exam stuff
ilovecats4606: i think totalynce dont want to do this
theseat_yt: It uses as much as an LED when turning on
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> Got it fixed
theseat_yt: Mhm
ilovecats4606: totalynce should help romdump with 10000 iq
theseat_yt: I’m not that smort
theseat_yt: .-.
ilovecats4606: reverse engineer the display to connect pi to it
theseat_yt: anyways he didnt need the insides anymore as they are broken
theseat_yt: I think
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> <@759251017287860244> A guy at my school took a calculator apart so he could put a raspberry pi inside, but accidentally broke some really small things while doing it, I could fix it by soldering where the parts were
theseat_yt: Free (broken) calculator aquired
ilovecats4606: I think totalyance is busy
theseat_yt: im that bored
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> If i have nothing to do, im just gonna dump a random address with my eyes closed
theseat_yt: Day 2 of waiting for ROM dump
theseat_yt: day 1 of waiting for rom dump
ilovecats4606: just ask totalyance
kribit: bruh chatgpt is not cooking
theseat_yt: We still haven’t tried chatGPT’s idea

3A 31 00 00 36 37 9A 3B D6 33 00 00 26 2C 3A 31 ?? ??
ilovecats4606: how to dump rom
ilovecats4606: ok
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> I got rid of it as it got a lot of negative feedback regarding it.
theseat_yt: The instructions are also wrong
theseat_yt: I added a disclaimer saying that it is a parody, and the binary isn't able to be able to be converted into legible code
ilovecats4606: sure whatever
theseat_yt: there is no reason for it to be a dmca
ilovecats4606: otherwise dcma or whatever
ilovecats4606: dont post here
ilovecats4606: link dms btw
ilovecats4606: did you add egyptian mode
ilovecats4606: where link
theseat_yt: thats intended
ilovecats4606: cut off by example 2
ilovecats4606: how moving???
whoisthat2009guy: uhh
theseat_yt: pretty accurate recreation if you ask me
ilovecats4606: bro needs to tell us how to find romdump
bn9u: tisk tisk tisk
theseat_yt: the only place I am sending it to is THIS channel, and it already has instructions for rom dump if you just scroll up
bn9u: ur giving too  much
theseat_yt: its not instructions
theseat_yt: its obviously a fake tutorial
bn9u: yes
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: did you even read it?????
bn9u: ur just giving people instructions on how to illegally obtain the firmware
theseat_yt: thats not the full thing, it is cropped
bn9u: bro
bn9u: 
theseat_yt: I am not using any copyrighted material
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: i used developer console
bn9u: there was a person who shared an emu rom on a github repo, and some drama here caused a person here to report it to casio or smth
theseat_yt: wdym
bn9u: bro ur gonna get us dmca'd again
ilovecats4606: it will be cooler with fx82au plus ii 2nd romdumps
theseat_yt: 28:05 is crazy
theseat_yt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA
cool new video 👍
ilovecats4606: in the next calculator i think casio should add rom dumping functioanliyt
bn9u: the main factor is the screen takes a bit to fully turn on / off pixels
bn9u: its like 4 bytes a second i think actually
ilovecats4606: the 9 hour thing
ilovecats4606: didnt you say the 1byte/sec
bn9u: iirc the function is in seg 1 so its difficult to find
theseat_yt: okay, so do you know how to get the checksum?
bn9u: with the diagnostics, it displays the checksum of the rom so teh factory knows the calc is good to sell to consumers

if we run that checksum, but for only 2 bytes, then it basically shows what those 2 bytes are in hex displayed as text on the screen
theseat_yt: what is that
bn9u: there is a thing called checksum dump
theseat_yt: <@705043446284419104> <@759251017287860244> do you know any string for rom dump currently (no matter how slow?)
ilovecats4606: it works so good tho
ilovecats4606: made by chatgpt 💀
ilovecats4606: you should check out the one in pinned
whoisthat2009guy: <:trollface:840751694639005747>
whoisthat2009guy: 
ilovecats4606: and just `from:totalyance in:#fx-82au-plus-ii-2nd`
ilovecats4606: very usefulnes
ilovecats4606: read pins
ilovecats4606: okokokok
whoisthat2009guy: will make because I always use 570esp screen dump template to make bro 😂
ilovecats4606: you got the tools to convert img2bin and disassembler???
ilovecats4606: share share
ilovecats4606: you know hackstring for this calc???
ilovecats4606: fr???
whoisthat2009guy: now I can only provide hackstring (will make soon) and you will record and send ur video, I will try processing pixels dump
whoisthat2009guy: not sure if I can bought au calculator because my grandma this time not let me to buy anymore 😂
ilovecats4606: first au calc to dump
ilovecats4606: freerom freerom
ilovecats4606: pls do it for fx82au plus ii 2nd
whoisthat2009guy: thats how I dumped myself 570vnplus (original + 2nd edition), 570esp 2nd edition
whoisthat2009guy: but hurt my eyes + tired because of checking pixel + cutting each frames of video
whoisthat2009guy: only take me approx 3minutes to record 😂
whoisthat2009guy: hmm my old method was a bit different, it's called swipe-screen
ilovecats4606: so we found new upgrade if we can find the right gadgets that is AMAZING ||2byte/sec (4.5hour)||
ilovecats4606: 1byte/sec or whatever
ilovecats4606: we have a method to screendump rom (9hour camera need)
whoisthat2009guy: a bit understand
ilovecats4606: .
whoisthat2009guy: ~~and <@981463678698266664> camera is so good anyway~~
whoisthat2009guy: btw how is the progress of dumping this rom?
whoisthat2009guy: 💀
ilovecats4606: new hackstring leak: ||[shift] [ac] crashes the calculator||
bn9u: Scroll up <@705043446284419104>
whoisthat2009guy: then its good
whoisthat2009guy: ah about esp(2nd) rom dumps if your calc can type hackstring
ilovecats4606: as for real romdumps, ask <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: thanks i almost forgot my streak
whoisthat2009guy: rom dump?
whoisthat2009guy: hmm?
theseat_yt: gn
theseat_yt: my calc is at school still
ilovecats4606: freerom freerom
ilovecats4606: do [44 chars] 202020202020... ac left equals
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> Chatgpt gave me this im pretty sure that it is wrong tho:
31 3A 00 00 37 36 3B 9A 33 D6 00 00 2C 26 31 3A ?? ?? (ER0 +1)
kribit: Lmao
ilovecats4606: "you can perform basic overflow by pressing [shift] [up] [5] [equals] [ac] [on]" ahh
bn9u: 99% of what it said was halucinations
theseat_yt: why won't it work
bn9u: grok = dummy
theseat_yt: read what grok said
bn9u: im only here for a bit
ilovecats4606: the master <@759251017287860244> is online so maybe you can ask
ilovecats4606: dump 372 bytes at a time
ilovecats4606: bro is going to be typing for about 67 days
theseat_yt: when I have my calculator
theseat_yt: I can do it tomorrow
ilovecats4606: instead of typing every single addr
ilovecats4606: but we use that to find gadgets to create a loop so the calc can do it
ilovecats4606: yes bro its what we've been doing to get the funny screen patterns
theseat_yt: do you think it would work?
ilovecats4606: the scond one is 7979r doesnt dump rom i dont think and is a mode68 hackstring
theseat_yt: I left my calculator at school 😭
ilovecats4606: i DARE you to do the first one
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> Does this sound accurate?
theseat_yt: Some info that grok gave me about the first edition
ilovecats4606: can do it tmr
ilovecats4606: its fine
bn9u: but im so tired
bn9u: we probs alr have it
bn9u: now we need mov er2 er0
ilovecats4606: wwww
bn9u: found it
bn9u: ```
00:3E60H    0100            MOV R1, #000H
_$01E:
00:3E62H    8010            MOV R0, R1
00:3E64H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: 
bn9u: ok a bit late
bn9u: ok
ilovecats4606: i tried
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: yeah try get better lighting
ilovecats4606: too uneven?
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: okokko
bn9u: verif menu
ilovecats4606: 3d is =
ilovecats4606: or use unstable
ilovecats4606: do i get from verif menu
ilovecats4606: 3d=???
ilovecats4606: c2 ranint
ilovecats4606: 0x3DC2
ilovecats4606: tyy
bn9u: that way less unstable
bn9u: 3DCE
bn9u: dump
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: i change my mind
bn9u: wait
bn9u: 3DC2
ilovecats4606: addr?
bn9u: this is emu rom so we need to dump this rq
bn9u: so er0 = 0001
bn9u: it sets r1 to 1
bn9u: then if we run the thikng before
bn9u: if we run this, it sets er0 to 0
bn9u: ```
00:3FBCH    0100            MOV R1, #000H
_$01E_9:
00:3FBEH    8010            MOV R0, R1
00:3FC0H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: hang on
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: to get 0001
bn9u: this is useful
bn9u: ```
00:3CAEH    0001            MOV R0, #001H
00:3CB0H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: now we just need to increment  address to start
bn9u: this is what we did
bn9u: ill make a lil mockup of what we doin
```
er2 = 0xa030
pop ea, er4, er2, er8, er0 = er2
ADDRESS_TO_START:
ss ss
xx xx xx 1F xx xx
r2 = 8:[ea+]
er0 = f830
[er0] = r2
```
ilovecats4606: 💀
ilovecats4606: u up for it
bn9u: well we lowk gotta make it ourselves this time
ilovecats4606: i can do the 9 hour 💀
ilovecats4606: its fine
bn9u: i can ask a friend rq
bn9u: i dont even know where it is
ilovecats4606: 2bytes method is viable?
ilovecats4606: 😭
bn9u: say that you are gay or smth
bn9u: explain it to them then
ilovecats4606: bc my parents are gonna be like "why tf r u recording calc screen"
ilovecats4606: broooo'
bn9u: but if you gonna take long why not long long
ilovecats4606: that is more doable for me
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: isint that better
bn9u: so its 4 and a half hours
ilovecats4606: bruh
ilovecats4606: 1!?!?!?!?one?!!?
bn9u: it dumps 2 bytes at a type
bn9u: there is actually another method
ilovecats4606: i will hide my phone under bed
ilovecats4606: ugh
bn9u: afaik nope
ilovecats4606: is there no other way
ilovecats4606: 🤡
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: you just need to have something that has a camera on for 9 hours
ilovecats4606: how???????
bn9u: you dont need to record
ilovecats4606: how tf am i meant to record 9 hours of footage
bn9u: no point
ilovecats4606: overclock it
ilovecats4606: 😭
bn9u: we can make some real time detection without saving the actual feed
bn9u: u dont have to record allat
bn9u: it will only take 9 hours
bn9u: dw
bn9u: ok
ilovecats4606: be recording for 67 decades with this one
ilovecats4606: thats slower than 2 bytes
ilovecats4606: oh hell nah 😭
bn9u: 1 byte at a time 🤓
bn9u: it means we can read data from seg 0
bn9u: good
bn9u: ok
bn9u: 0xF8
ilovecats4606: wait more than 5 because that 0 ius cut off
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: 👟

ilovecats4606: no cv34 ?
ilovecats4606: cool
bn9u: its also the space character in ascii
bn9u: `AtWt ` N
is atomic weight, it returns the atomic weight of the periodic table element N 
it only exists / works on the japanese regional models
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: you went 1 over
bn9u: no
bn9u: wait
bn9u: yes
bn9u: oh whoops
ilovecats4606: bro what 💀 i got AtWt
bn9u: 19 looks like me
bn9u: cs 18 loops like mp
ilovecats4606: dyk what cs18 and 19 and cv34 look like
bn9u: ok
ilovecats4606: i will make one mysel from token list]
bn9u: do something
ilovecats4606: bruh nvm
bn9u: and like
ilovecats4606: ssh 😭
bn9u: turn on the computer
bn9u: and like

bn9u: its on my discord bot even
ilovecats4606: i modify it
ilovecats4606: send
bn9u: its for models with cs and cv
ilovecats4606: ??!??!?!
bn9u: but
bn9u: i have one actually
ilovecats4606: time to do it
ilovecats4606: just make python script to convert better 👍

bn9u: just wall
bn9u: no door
bn9u: no backdoor
bn9u: no front door
bn9u: we think it doesnt have an interface to interact with the chip
ilovecats4606: aint no way casio encrypted rom
ilovecats4606: why
bn9u: but we lowk cant
bn9u: called being smart
bn9u: not cheating
ilovecats4606: and no fun
ilovecats4606: that would be cheating tho
ilovecats4606: is it worth it to buy a programmer and read the chip
bn9u: this is what is is meant to look like
bn9u: but it was broken
bn9u: here is the dump thing
ilovecats4606: if it resorts to that i will put it in a drawer with perfect lighting condition i will check with external monitor and plug in phone
ilovecats4606: pov my phone dies halfway
ilovecats4606: 1 hour 😭
bn9u: but all of this didnt goto waste we got a ton of useful gadgets
bn9u: you just have to lowk record a video for 1 hour
bn9u: but its got a timer, so its super accurate for reading data
bn9u: like dumps 2 bytes a second
bn9u: but its super slow
bn9u: a dump haackstring that i made for another calc that lowk doesnt work
bn9u: btw if this doesnt work we have an alternative
bn9u: this means that er0 has to not be 0
bn9u: hmmm
ilovecats4606: i want to learn this
ilovecats4606: i wish i was as talented as u 😭
bn9u: and maybe this one
bn9u: ```

bn9u: it might exist on real tho idk
bn9u: we need to find L ER8, [ER0] but it doesnt exist on emu rom
bn9u: no like
ilovecats4606: another pic ?
bn9u: we need to find a replacement
bn9u: u
bn9u: ugh
bn9u: L ER8, [ER0] is missing
ilovecats4606: btw these are actually 2 different pics lol they look so similar wtf
ilovecats4606: www
ilovecats4606: oh ok
bn9u: now we uber duber close
bn9u: i didnt really need the pic, i was testing to see if the pop er0 gadget in segment 1 worked (the first 30 30 was the data for er0 and the 76 58 31 30 was the pop er0 gadget)
ilovecats4606: damn thats crazyy
bn9u: he may or may not of won international programming comps and stuff
ilovecats4606: amazing person
ilovecats4606: with all of what hes done
ilovecats4606: i wish him all the best
ilovecats4606: and i wanna run pythong cause dont wanna compile
ilovecats4606: yes but not specifically for nxu8 and the ones that are in eg for casioemumsvc is c
bn9u: okay
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: he has a life now 😢
bn9u: he is in this server but hardly talks
bn9u: user202729 basically made this stuff super popular, he made the dump program and a whole bunch of other stuff
bn9u: dissassembler*
there are others out there aswell
bn9u: drama
bn9u: its kinda sadge
ilovecats4606: creator of binary to asm
ilovecats4606: why steveyboy leave
bn9u: it might be in downloads somewhere
ilovecats4606: might fix
ilovecats4606: just sihost
ilovecats4606: classic windows moment 😭
bn9u: ohh yeah
bn9u: im having fun with windows
ilovecats4606: the binary to asm
ilovecats4606: yes but its private
bn9u: lol
bn9u: i did hardly any of this from scratch, that img2bin was made by another guy, that grid thing another guy, the whole program to dump seg 0 was  another guy, all we are doing is replicating their work for this calc
ilovecats4606: bro i was abt to type those numbers in and i realise i gotta conver them
ilovecats4606: i would have to build it from scratch reading the processor instruction manual
ilovecats4606: even if i knew 100% assembly and stuff i dont know the SP offset, i dont have the tools to convert a romdump img to binary
bn9u: ~~i was bored~~
ilovecats4606: ty for massive carries btw there has been no work about this, i joined at the start of the year with no hope and soon the rom might be dumped 😱

ilovecats4606: freerom freerom
theseat_yt: Here u are
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: its turning on now
theseat_yt: it will be about 3 minutes till u get it
theseat_yt: my ipads flat and on charge
theseat_yt: I got it
ilovecats4606: free chatgpts strat
theseat_yt: 2C (high byte) → from the table, 2Ch = ,

A2 (low byte) → from the table, A2h = tan(

So 0x2CA2 corresponds to the token sequence:

, tan(
bn9u: so this
bn9u: to get the address to type you subtract 0x0C from the adress, convert it to chars, then yeah swap them around
so 0x2CAE = 0x2CA2 = , tan( = tan( ,
ilovecats4606: no follow totalyance
theseat_yt: do you tan( and ,  around or no
ilovecats4606: ty
bn9u: gl
ilovecats4606: performance for 1 hour 😬
bn9u: enjoy your 4 hours of outness
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: bruhye
bn9u: 44 chars ->D - 0 0 tan( , 0 0 0 0 0 0...
ilovecats4606: A2 is tan
ilovecats4606: ugh
ilovecats4606: wait i forgot to swap the chars
ilovecats4606: bruh i will just do manually
theseat_yt: chatgpt says tan( ,
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> does that look right
ilovecats4606: you overwrite unstable with cube root and flash twice before lockin
ilovecats4606: so hackstring is  ->D-00,<cube root and 2 flashes>
ilovecats4606: so the chars is , and then cube root and 2 flashes
ilovecats4606: , ^3√(+2)
ilovecats4606: pro strat
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: i can get the chars for u if u want
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> what are the characters?
ilovecats4606: 0X2CA2
theseat_yt: oki thx
ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> 0x2CAE-0x0C

bn9u: what he said
ilovecats4606: find gadget

theseat_yt: i didnt rlly comprehend half of it
bn9u: its actually `μe` but it looks like me
ilovecats4606: thats 3 bytes tho
ilovecats4606: i write +34?
bn9u: dw nothing too important
theseat_yt: i just caught up on 250 messgaes 😭😭😭😭
ilovecats4606: 🗿
bn9u: time = money

theseat_yt: its really not that hard
bn9u: 22 looks like `me`
bn9u: also
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: -0x0c?
bn9u: you can cheat it by deleting unstable byte, and doing +34
bn9u: u have to use unstable for 22
bn9u: ok dump 0x22B2

ilovecats4606: bro iedk what r and er and stuff is
bn9u: which in theory should be fine
bn9u: r6 and er12 get destroyed
bn9u: it means we have to pad 4 bytes afterwards tho

ilovecats4606: bro
bn9u: nah lol
bn9u: we just cant dump the model
ilovecats4606: now what
ilovecats4606: noo
bn9u: meaning the gadget doesnt exist
bn9u: there is nothing that has pop pc or rt afterwards
bn9u: but
bn9u: i need mov r2, r0
ilovecats4606: wha
ilovecats4606: 😨

ilovecats4606: so which addr now
ilovecats4606: i am. back

ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: wait i brb 3 min
bn9u: ```
R2 = R0

bn9u: so
bn9u: the real address is 0x2C26

bn9u: BUT
bn9u: which is sad
bn9u: we only ran the last 2 lines
ilovecats4606: realrom != emurom
ilovecats4606: wait does that mean
bn9u: TURNS OUT
ilovecats4606: can i pay for totalynce premium pro plus and have that in plain english pls
bn9u: (the first 2 lines)
bn9u: was er2 set to 0099
bn9u: what was MEANT to happen
bn9u: ```
01:2C28H    0300            MOV R3, #000H

bn9u: mb
bn9u: er2*
bn9u: oh fu
bn9u: er0 was NOT set
bn9u: so that means
bn9u: input area starts at 8154

bn9u: if you pay for totalynce premium

ilovecats4606: it is
ilovecats4606: theres 2 C im assumign its the one after P
bn9u: permu is P
bn9u: C
ilovecats4606: is combi P or C
ilovecats4606: w
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: is ran+2 q3
ilovecats4606: got it lesgooo
bn9u: J>kgf.m
ilovecats4606: b
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: web emu that has constants and conversion
ilovecats4606: do you get it from the emurom
ilovecats4606: cv34?
ilovecats4606: lmfao
ilovecats4606: bro the hackstring looks so stupid
ilovecats4606: got it
bn9u: km>mile
bn9u: hang on
ilovecats4606: what does cv08 look oilke
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: lmfao
ilovecats4606: bro the m just disappeared
bn9u: sure
ilovecats4606: cannn i deletet aooooooioi
ilovecats4606: so i can delete ao?
bn9u: omg
bn9u: how did i never realise that
bn9u: if you override the unstable byte, then delete it,  it starts from 0 again, so then 2.5s later you get 05
ilovecats4606: bro its 999<unstable>aoao
bn9u: there is an even easier way
ilovecats4606: huhhhh
bn9u: im dumb
bn9u: WAITTT
ilovecats4606: wtf
bn9u: OR
ilovecats4606: theres 2 ao
bn9u: you found it because of the 50 sto M
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: i just found it
ilovecats4606: wait is it ao
bn9u: ye
bn9u: lmk when you get to the cs05 part
ilovecats4606: ill tell u when i get to that part
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: yes, just continue typing the hackstring as normal
ilovecats4606: wait i stored 50 into M
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: 44 chars cv08 ! 0 0 0 cv34 ran#+2 4 0 0 Combi Combi Ran# cs05 1 0 0 0 0...
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: yess
bn9u: 44 chars then type what chat gee pee tea said then 0's
ilovecats4606: do i need to do the 44 offset
ilovecats4606: how hackstring
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: is it right
bn9u: im surprised it diddecently well
ilovecats4606: im at 999|A=0
ilovecats4606: how do i enter hackstring
ilovecats4606: ohhh ok
bn9u: basically whatever you typed gets stored as nibbles, so 50 gets stored as 0x50
but vairables have an extra nibble at the start so its actually 0x050
ilovecats4606: is it like little endian so it stores in reverse ?
ilovecats4606: Combi = 12 after ran
bn9u: its how variables are stored
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> is this right
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: why is 50 M = 05
ilovecats4606: whatataTAT??T??A?T?A?
bn9u: He probs won't help much
bn9u: You can get 05 easily by doing 50 shift rcl M+ before doing a=0 overflow then when you need to type the 05 just spam slowly to the m variable and ao should be there
ilovecats4606: (28 after RanInt#() ! 0 0 0
ilovecats4606: I got this so far
ilovecats4606: I will just ask chatgpt..
ilovecats4606: F8 😭
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: bro there is so much unstable
bn9u: Lol 67
ilovecats4606: bro DE requires unstable for about 67 years
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: or at the sp offest
bn9u: convert the hex to tokens
ilovecats4606: wait how just in normal comp
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: broooooioioioi
bn9u: i know a way to make it easier
bn9u: wait
bn9u: ACTUALLY
bn9u: it looks like `ao` when you get it
bn9u: btw to get 05 you have to do unstable for 3 business days
bn9u: anyway
bn9u: i chose BF BF istead of 30 30 because it would be easier to see ig
bn9u: type in this hackstring: (its in hex)

`DE 57 30 30 30 F8 8E 34 30 30 BF BF 8C 05 31 30`
bn9u: okay
bn9u: in theory, you should see the pixels show up on the top left of the screen like this:
00110000
ilovecats4606: broo what 😭 ill just press the buttons
bn9u: first we set er8 to smth, i set it to F830 (screen region)
then we set er2 to 30 30
(r2 = 30 r3 = 30)
then we test the st r2 er8 thing
so the address of er8 should be set to r2 (30) IN THEORY byt the gadget's code has a pop xr4 (xr registers are 4 bytes long so i add xx xx xx xx)
then 30 30 30 30 (0's to halt the rop program)
ilovecats4606: half of me wants you to explain everything and half of me not bothered at all and just press button
bn9u: 57DE is pop er8
348E is pop er2
ilovecats4606: how
bn9u: we test it by doing this:
```
pop er8
30 F8
pop er2
30 30
ST R2, [ER8]
xx xx xx xx
30 30 30 30
```
bn9u: so we need to test it
bn9u: its likely to be same on real hardware
bn9u: its a segment 1 gadget
bn9u: ```
01:058CH    9281            ST R2, [ER8]```
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: ill look for [ER8] = R2
bn9u: we just need these now
bn9u: 
bn9u: another one i misread
bn9u: shi
ilovecats4606: now what
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: its just render
bn9u: we alr have it
bn9u: oh
bn9u: 😭
bn9u: i dide
bn9u: no
bn9u: wait
bn9u: ```
00:2EA8H    02D0            MOV R2, #0D0H

00:2F7CH    F28E            POP PC```
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: should be fine
ilovecats4606: too uneven?
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: is that decimal?
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: 28 (
2E .
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: 0x2E28
bn9u: dump 0x2E34
bn9u: 00:2EF6H on emu
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: im trying to find it
bn9u: no
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: dump 0x87D0
bn9u: MOV ER0, 0x87D0
bn9u: we dump more now
ilovecats4606: what now
bn9u: 
bn9u: 
bn9u: mb
ilovecats4606: pin right message 😭
ilovecats4606: brooooo

ilovecats4606: no unstables requried
bn9u: yessssss
ilovecats4606: ->D-00sqrt6
ilovecats4606: easy easy
ilovecats4606: 98 is sqrt
36 is 6
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: can you pin this
ilovecats4606: https://github.com/fxesdev/115esp2/blob/main/Token_List.md
bn9u: yuh
bn9u: <:iosmoai:1040846251459088394>
ilovecats4606: 0x3698
ilovecats4606: 🗿
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: minus 0x0c?
bn9u: dump 36A4
ilovecats4606: so what to do
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: seg 1 is pretty similar to real hardware on esp 2 models
bn9u: but
bn9u: seg 1 is difficult because you cant read segment 1 by doing render anymore
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> how seg1 hard
ilovecats4606: ?????/
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: replace ->D-00 wigh 01
ilovecats4606: 😭
bn9u: after that its 
# ||__*Segment 1*__||
sjuper scjary
bn9u: we get segment 0
bn9u: then
bn9u: 9 things left to find
bn9u: ill write down everything left we ened to find
```
R2 = R0
[ER0] = R2
POP EA; MOV R9, #05H```
bn9u: you dont need to understand it, we just need to find the gadgets
ilovecats4606: this thing makes no sense to me
ilovecats4606: bro how 😭
bn9u: what it does or what it means doesnt really matter right now
bn9u: <@981463678698266664> we basically have to find all of this
bn9u: ```
ss ss xx xx xx 1F xx xx
R2 = 08:[EA+]
CMP R4, #00DH
2E 8C
ER8 = [ER0]
[ER8] = R2

```
bn9u: ima translate this into ropasm then we will try to create it again
bn9u: idk where to ye
bn9u: uhh
ilovecats4606: i can dump addr
ilovecats4606: i am now home
ilovecats4606: now we need to do the fx82au plus ii 2nd romdumps
ilovecats4606: bruh
jsaidoru: maybe
ilovecats4606: dm?
jsaidoru: interesting
ilovecats4606: just use google translate if u don’t speak viet
ilovecats4606: i can share in dms
ilovecats4606: fx580 got big viet community
bn9u: chilll
jsaidoru: why are you making this so annoying.
first im not interested in this model
second i dont know about rop
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: like anything above 0x6766 will probably have a different offset
bn9u: yes but it only works for like 200 addresses
ilovecats4606: so if we find addr on emurom we just do that offset for realrom?
bn9u: thats the offset needed to apply for addresses > 0x6502 on the emu rom
ilovecats4606: so 0x6502-0x280?
bn9u: offset
bn9u: but if we only go a few lines down on the real disas
0x6282 on real translates to 0x6502 on emu
that is 0x280
bn9u: so that  offset of 0x15C
bn9u: on the emu, there is this giant function inbetween this and the next thing
bn9u: but
bn9u: this gadget is 63D8 on emu
ilovecats4606: they have the same thing?
bn9u: is that
bn9u: what i see in the comparison betweent he real and emu disas
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: here
bn9u: and yes]=
bn9u: i just disassembled this
ilovecats4606: did u get it?
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: at least its better than getting Fx chars
bn9u: its unstable
bn9u: ahh
bn9u: now we got gadget to lewp
bn9u: ```
00:627CH    A1EA            MOV SP, ER14

bn9u: 
bn9u: 
bn9u: <@981463678698266664> 
remember to add 0x0C to the adr so you technically dumped 0x6274
ilovecats4606: u should help
jsaidoru: gonna take a while <:trollface:1272038457900011540>
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: there was one topleft, fixed
ilovecats4606: any diff
ilovecats4606: ok gn
bn9u: Yknow timezones
bn9u: And I gotta sleep
bn9u: I need better image
ilovecats4606: bruh i will just dump myself..
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> did you get the bin from img
bn9u: the owner was like "he hates free speech for some reason" and like dude i wonder what <#894070851345989642>  are
ilovecats4606: no more freerom 😭
theseat_yt: O no the mods are here to ban me
.wav3.: Banned
bn9u: https://tenor.com/view/bane-no-banned-and-you-are-explode-gif-16047504
theseat_yt: (THIS IS A JOKE AND VERY UNSERIOUS)
Or we could use unforced child labor
(THIS IS A JOKE AND VERY UNSERIOUS)
bn9u: train a human
theseat_yt: You wouldn’t train an llm
ilovecats4606: casio casio
ilovecats4606: freerom
ilovecats4606: train llm to read casio screen
ilovecats4606: yes yes
bn9u: i feel like an ai would have a better chance because I guess it would compare pixels near to each other
theseat_yt: This is the best you’re gonna get
bn9u: oh yeah
ilovecats4606: "no mistake"
ilovecats4606: chatgpt code is flawless
ilovecats4606: dont worry
bn9u: just wait till you get back to take a better pic
bn9u: <@782395167079792691>
bn9u: you can keep it on forever in this state
bn9u: ur in the car again 💀
theseat_yt: I’m sorry if they are bad I’m in a moving car
theseat_yt: 
bn9u: get teh best pic you can
theseat_yt: Okai
bn9u: photo
theseat_yt: Also should I video or just photo?
ilovecats4606: freerom freerom casio casio
ilovecats4606: lock innn
theseat_yt: Take 2
theseat_yt: Okay now I have the ->D
bn9u: rip
ilovecats4606: oop opk
ilovecats4606: if you did maybe you were off with the sp thingy
theseat_yt: Nup I’m dum
ilovecats4606: did you type ->D-00log(neg(
bn9u: at the start?
bn9u: did you do the ->D
bn9u: then you typed it wrong
theseat_yt: It crashed for some reason
bn9u: its because it lowk doesnt know what to do when it is out of bounds
bn9u: i said that ages agoe
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: i swear it shifts
bn9u: yess
ilovecats4606: it overwrites??
ilovecats4606: when you write in front of chars
ilovecats4606: bro wtf
bn9u: then spam 0's and then ac left equals like normal
theseat_yt: I’m up to …-00log(Neg(
bn9u: yeah it looks like neg(
bn9u: ->D - 0 0 log( (-)+2
ilovecats4606: spedrun time
ilovecats4606: i at unstable
ilovecats4606: 🤡
bn9u: 😭
theseat_yt: Omfg I just forgot to type -00
bn9u: if you put (-) in unstable, after 0.5s it becomes (-)+1, anoteh
ilovecats4606: mbbb
ilovecats4606: ohhhh wahtt
ilovecats4606: OHHH
bn9u: so
bn9u: unstable incs every 0.5s
theseat_yt: So it’s Neg(
bn9u: the pluses mean how much to inc on unstable
ilovecats4606: ??
?
ilovecats4606: we want 62h
ilovecats4606: wait im so confused what does +1 +2 +3 mean
bn9u: 1 second
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: and wait 2 sec
ilovecats4606: oh yeah you can do that
bn9u: its the button above RCl and below frac
theseat_yt: Oh okay
ilovecats4606: Press exponent on unstable and wait 4 sec then grab it
theseat_yt: Okay so no brackets
bn9u: negative
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: Is (-) minus?
bn9u: my egglish
bn9u: (-)+2 is unstable
ilovecats4606: no
ilovecats4606: wait
theseat_yt: Okai
bn9u: nononon
bn9u: log( = 0x68
ilovecats4606: You dont need unstable, just do ->D-00log( (-)+2 0000
bn9u: log( (-)+2 is 0x6268H
ilovecats4606: bruh
ilovecats4606: it said on the sheet but how does that work
ilovecats4606: howww
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: wait youcan do that??????
bn9u: ik 62 is unstable
ilovecats4606: ????
bn9u: nonono just type log( (-)+2 as the addr
theseat_yt: -00??
theseat_yt: I’m at unstable rn
theseat_yt: So what are the specific order of characters do I have to type
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: so 0x6268
theseat_yt: Idc how hard they are
ilovecats4606: bro im the one typing 😭
ilovecats4606: 62 is still unstable bro
bn9u: because they are annoying to type
theseat_yt: Why?
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: i want to minimize the unstable bytes
ilovecats4606: 6268
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: do 68
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: huh
bn9u: no dont do that yet
bn9u: oh
ilovecats4606: 0x626A
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: https://github.com/fxesdev/115esp2/blob/main/Token_List.md?
bn9u: dump 0x6276
theseat_yt: There is a list somewhere I know but I can’t be bothered
bn9u: okay
theseat_yt: Idk how to make that into characters I have to get from unstable
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: just wait
ilovecats4606: do i need to take away 0x0c
bn9u: i think it is at `0x627C` on the real (15c offset)
theseat_yt: I got plenty of free time
theseat_yt: So what characters do I have to get?
bn9u: ```
00:63D8H    A1EA            MOV SP, ER14
00:63DAH    FE1E            POP ER14
00:63DCH    FE1F            RT```
on emu
bn9u: naur
theseat_yt: I’ll do it 🫡
bn9u: yeah getting a better one
ilovecats4606: or cantry to find more gadget
ilovecats4606: i can get f6 and f8 now
theseat_yt: I can get F6 and F8 when I get home
bn9u: mov sp. er14*
and not like access, just type it in as a gadget
theseat_yt: So to get MOV SP we gotta access the 3BF6H memory address?
bn9u: we are going to find better gadget
bn9u: this is so far the gadgets that we need to loopp, but as you see, F6 and F8 are annoying to get because of unstable
bn9u: we can do lewp
ilovecats4606: or u too busy
ilovecats4606: do we do loop today
khaidoeseverything: Dang
theseat_yt: Just messing around
theseat_yt: I was doing ilovecat’s tutorial on getting the binary hex counter and changed the steps slightly
khaidoeseverything: Lmao
theseat_yt: I have no idea lol
khaidoeseverything: How do u get ts?
theseat_yt: I saw that u guys found out the basics of videoing the rom 👀
bn9u: you can do this: reset 68 and do some stuff in the box, it can edit some of those integrity check zones and it will reset when you press on
ilovecats4606: ||jokes there is no freerom today 😭 ||
ilovecats4606: scroll up to find :D
ilovecats4606: freerom alert
theseat_yt: Just caught up on 82 messages 🫥
ilovecats4606: so silly
ilovecats4606: you cant do full full full reset unless you crash calc
bn9u: it full full full resets
bn9u: and when it fails
bn9u: because it currupts ram with the hackstring, and wheny you press on, the calc checks like every 10 bytes or smth if the high nibble is 0
(0x67 will fail the integrity check because 6 is not 0)
(0x01 will pass because 0 is 0)
ilovecats4606: does crash calc do a full reset?
ilovecats4606: why tho?
ilovecats4606: yes thats how it
ilovecats4606: OHHH
ilovecats4606: ty
bn9u: u can reset it by doing a hackstring that crashes the calc
khaidoeseverything: Shift 7 on, 9, press on again, counter should reset
bn9u: i forgor then
ilovecats4606: is still same
ilovecats4606: the counter
bn9u: you can reset by doing shift 9 3 =
khaidoeseverything: Still got it lmao
ilovecats4606: idk somehow it eventually resets but idk how
khaidoeseverything: Hol up
ilovecats4606: nope it didnt reset
khaidoeseverything: Yeah I think doing that resets it every time
ilovecats4606: it goes through display and the sumcheck and the buttontest right
khaidoeseverything: Then it should do it
khaidoeseverything: Press 9 I think
ilovecats4606: how do you reset the counter????
ilovecats4606: if you get it right it increase
ilovecats4606: wait nvm
theseat_yt: Part of a fraction
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: how do you even get the number before to increase
khaidoeseverything: Idk I just shitpost🫩
khaidoeseverything: Yooooooo
bn9u: what is ur tiktok abt bruh 💀
ilovecats4606: https://imgur.com/a/0USm7T8
khaidoeseverything: Idk how to do that sorry
ilovecats4606: :)
ilovecats4606: fx82au plus ii 2nd freeroms
ilovecats4606: more useful would be an fx82au plus ii 2nd romdumps
khaidoeseverything: Ah well😔

khaidoeseverything: Singular pixel
khaidoeseverything: 
bn9u: furry p-?
khaidoeseverything: Nah I ain’t that smart
ilovecats4606: spill spill
ilovecats4606: fx82au plus ii 2nd romdumps????
khaidoeseverything: Idk if it’s important
ilovecats4606: freerom??????
khaidoeseverything: I may have found something
khaidoeseverything: Chat
khaidoeseverything: Balright
bn9u: (the owner is still causing drama btw)
khaidoeseverything: I have returned after a year
khaidoeseverything: Balright
bn9u: mr Einstein
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: also btw the hackstring is copied every 100 bytes until end of ram so if your hackstring reaches 100 bytes long, then it will continue again from the start (so you can actually use those 44 zeros) but if you try to make it a loop, it will only loop ~20 times becuase it isnt actually looping
ilovecats4606: wait that makes so much sense tysmmmm
ilovecats4606: because sp offset is 44 bytes
ilovecats4606: 44 zeros
ilovecats4606: THATS WHY]
ilovecats4606: OHHH
bn9u: okay ill just like demonstrate here i guess
lets say you have your hackstring
```
... 0 0 0 ->D - 0 0 3 5 0 0 ....
          ^
     stack pointer
```
the stack pointer by default when you "execute" this will be  at ->D
and how hackstrings work, is the calc will eventually run a POP PC instruction (starting the rop)
and it will pop the next 4 bytes into PC (where code is executing from)
and continue executing code there
```
... 0 0 0 ->D - 0 0 3 5 0 0 ....
          |_______|
           POP PC
```
now it will jump to that piece of code
 4A 2D 30 30 is ->D - 0 0 in hex
0:2D4AH
is the address
now here is some example code for that
```
0:2D4AH POP ER2
0:2D4CH POP PC
```
when you jump to 0:2D4AH
POP ER2 is run 
Er2 is 2 bytes large
so 2 bytes are popped from SP
```
... 0 0 0 ->D - 0 0 3 5 0 0 ....
                   |___|
                  POP ER2
```
so 3 5 (0x3530) is stored into er2
then POP PC is run
```
... 0 0 0 ->D - 0 0 3 5 0 0 ....
                        |_______|
                         POP PC
```
and the "chain" continues
khaidoeseverything: Balright
ilovecats4606: i found one for arm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV6P5eRmMh8
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: good video >
ilovecats4606: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGL4qGVyK-U
bn9u: you will get the hang of it
bn9u: dw
bn9u: RT is return, it jumps to the LR register (by default, the LR register points to a routine that doesnt screw up the hackstring, and ends in pop pc (pop pc means jump to the next gadget))
ilovecats4606: huhhhhh 😭
bn9u: obj is basically the 2nd operand of the isntruction
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: i will ask chatgpt 😭
bn9u: 
bn9u: it basically summarises every possible instruction
ilovecats4606: literally 67?
bn9u: but in rop push is very dangerous because it overwrites bytes in your code
bn9u: and same with push
bn9u: pop is like list.pop() in python
bn9u: if you start reading from page
# __*67*__
then it might be a bit easier
bn9u: maybe arm, because its pretty much a super stripped down arm thing
ilovecats4606: bro i dont understnad 😭
ilovecats4606: 00:3BF6H    A1EA            MOV SP, ER14 wait so this is "move stackpointer to  er14"
00:3BF8H    FE1E            POP ER14
00:3BFAH    FE1F            RT

idk whta popo and rt is
bn9u: reading this will help the best
ilovecats4606: what video should i watch
bn9u: sure, but this asm is very different
bn9u: i explained the -2,
so when you run 3BF6, it will run 
```
00:3BF6H    A1EA            MOV SP, ER14
00:3BF8H    FE1E            POP ER14
00:3BFAH    FE1F            RT
```
on the cpu
MOV SP, ER14 sets SP (the stack pointer / current position) to ER14 (we set it do ad dr -2 earlier)
then it will run POP ER14
this will take 2 bytes from the current position, and then move foward by 2 bytes, if we dont subtract 2 then it will start again halfway through a gadget (because gadgets are 4 bytes long)
ilovecats4606: ik MOV is move and thats it
ilovecats4606: i dont really understand should i watch a video on asm
ilovecats4606: and why -2
ilovecats4606: how to run 2 addr
bn9u: this is useful
bn9u: ```
00:3CAEH    0001            MOV R0, #001H
00:3CB0H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: 
bn9u: becuase its F8 and F6 it will be a very annoying unstable byte thing
bn9u: actually
bn9u: we do -2 becuase when it jumps there, it will still pop er14 (2 bytes) so it will move foward by 2 bytes
bn9u: if you run
0:3BF8
<ad dr - 2>
and then run
0:3BF6
it will jump to ad dr
ilovecats4606: thats so cool
ilovecats4606: damnnnnnn
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: video romdump
ilovecats4606: video?
bn9u: SO
bn9u: now we can create a loop
ilovecats4606: wow
bn9u: we got the thing i was looking for
bn9u: ```
00:3BF6H    A1EA            MOV SP, ER14
00:3BF8H    FE1E            POP ER14
00:3BFAH    FE1F            RT
```
bn9u: btw
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: let me see if i can do it
bn9u: so i selected an off one from the left and on one on the right
bn9u: also tip:
for selecting off pixel select the like dark ish off on, and the the on pixel select a light ish one
bn9u: to use it you select the image file, then 4 corners of the screen, then an "off" pixel and then an "on" pixel, adjust the theshold and manually change then export bin
ilovecats4606: that is still crazy good tho
ilovecats4606: ah
bn9u: bottom right
bn9u: 1 pixel
bn9u: oh
ilovecats4606: damn
bn9u: 
bn9u: lol no manual adjustment needed
bn9u: kewl
ilovecats4606: its quite good
ilovecats4606: except for 1 2 3 messed up
ilovecats4606: idk why it doubleded it but damn its accurate
ilovecats4606: btw i made a chat account and asked this
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: <a:catflop:1379700360431796286>
ilovecats4606: oh my gosh i just overtyped K 2 times in a row
ilovecats4606: i cant type : in lineio so i just start from 9
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: so like for now ignore the thrid column
bn9u: no one really talks about the ascii representation which i would call it idk ascii representation
bn9u: token and char are mixed around
bn9u: notice how Sin( is like 4 things s i n (
bn9u: token is the actual character in the formula
ilovecats4606: wait whats the differente between token and char
bn9u: btw you wont see ; (semicolon) because that is the ascii representation (only see it if it is used in printline funciton) and in reality it will look like the letter k
ilovecats4606: 8c RAN#
3b is ; which is one unstable after :

So the HS is ->D-00Ran#;
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: 3b8c
bn9u: uhh yeah
ilovecats4606: sorry
ilovecats4606: oh to shift it up
ilovecats4606: why subtract
ilovecats4606: add?
bn9u: so subtract
bn9u: you need to subtract 0x0C first to account for the indicator line
ilovecats4606: 0x0c
ilovecats4606: i need to add the
ilovecats4606: wait
bn9u: but
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: 98 is SQRT
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: <@981463678698266664> i want you to dump 0x3B98
bn9u: (5A92 on emu)
bn9u: 0x15C offset at 0x5936 onwards
bn9u: ```
00:5934H    0000            MOV R0, #000H
00:5936H    F28E            POP PC```
r0 = 0
bn9u: pop er4
bn9u: ```
00:582EH    F41E            POP ER4
00:5830H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: we got pop er8
bn9u: ```
00:57DAH    F205            MOV ER2, ER0
.j_057DC:
00:57DCH    F025            MOV ER0, ER2
00:57DEH    F81E            POP ER8
00:57E0H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: 
bn9u: 
bn9u: and it knows all the algo
bn9u: i sucks at python
bn9u: i know
ilovecats4606: its chatgpt code
bn9u: 3 pixels off
bn9u: it was really good this time
bn9u: 
bn9u: i was thinking it was gonna be crap at auto guessing
ilovecats4606: i am fortune teller
ilovecats4606: you were eating ice cream
ilovecats4606: i knew it
bn9u: i was eating ice cream
ilovecats4606: i think totalynce eating ice cream
theseat_yt: Smae
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: g
ilovecats4606: sneding
bn9u: pic?
bn9u: 3 decades???
ilovecats4606: hp voyager lasting 3 decades
bn9u: yeah these things tend to last a wee while
bn9u: lol
bn9u: also because we are in verif mode, you get access to < = > <= >= and !=
ilovecats4606: i havent changed in 3 years
ilovecats4606: dumped
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: btw we are trying to recreate this whole _thing_ for this model to dump the first segment
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: use low battery 👍
ilovecats4606: new strat for mode68
bn9u: low battery tends to help with timing because cpu slows down
bn9u: unlucky
ilovecats4606: bro it just got me 20 triest to get into submode0
bn9u: bruh
bn9u: u
ilovecats4606: wait i forgot -00
ilovecats4606: crash 💀
bn9u: because you cant insert characters between each other, whatever you type when your cursor is there will override them
bn9u: you can ignore those
ilovecats4606: i have to go forward and delte
ilovecats4606: bro i always see some MpMnMn after unstable when i delete so annoynig
ilovecats4606: no its ok
bn9u: im sorry i made that condusing
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: RanInt!
bn9u: so 0x57C2
bn9u: subtract 0x0C
bn9u: to get the dump addr
bn9u: dump 0x57CE
bn9u: i need to tink
ilovecats4606: which addr do i dump
ilovecats4606: bro what 💀
bn9u: idk
bn9u: wait
bn9u: i misunderstood
bn9u: wait sorry
bn9u: if you do preans+6 then the real addres you will dump is 0x57DA
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: I need to add 12 bytes
ilovecats4606: sorry
ilovecats4606: oh wait
ilovecats4606: not >D-00PreAns+6!
ilovecats4606: what
bn9u: with this hackstring
bn9u: yes
bn9u: you cant read data  in the indicator line because you can only see like 18 __bits__ out of the 12 __bytes__ that are there
ilovecats4606: so i dump this addr
bn9u: i said CE instead of C2 because the indicator line is 12 bytes (0x0C in hex)
ilovecats4606: ?
bn9u: he did ->D - 0 0 ranint#( !
ilovecats4606: whatever preans+6 is on it
ilovecats4606: so the hs is: ->D-00PreAns+6!
ilovecats4606: okok
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: there is multiple @'s
bn9u: no
ilovecats4606: but theres multiple ! isint there
bn9u: you can type ! btw
ilovecats4606: CE = PreAns+6 (12 from ranint)
57=! (17 from F)
theseat_yt: (Approximately)
theseat_yt: How many combinations do we need until we fully dump the rom?
ilovecats4606: this ! is different tho
ilovecats4606: ?
bn9u: bore your dentist with useless info
bn9u: 💀
theseat_yt: I brought my calc along
theseat_yt: I’m in a car, drove into the city for a dental appointment
bn9u: its CE because C2 + 0x0C = CE (indicator line is 12 bytes (0x0C in hex))
ilovecats4606: PreAns+6 (12 from ranint) !
bn9u: you converted the ascii into hex, not the actual char
ilovecats4606: unstable
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: 0x57CE
ilovecats4606: 021C2H
theseat_yt: This one is randint(!
ilovecats4606: 🍿
bn9u: now i want a pop er8
ilovecats4606: ohhh
bn9u: you have to use a hackstring to get it
bn9u: like you cant type it
bn9u: you cant get 00 bytes with unstable
ilovecats4606: so we dont need to overflow with unstablwe
ilovecats4606: cool
ilovecats4606: is <@782395167079792691>'s
bn9u: this region has an offset of `0x12C`
bn9u: pop er2
bn9u: this is what I was after
bn9u: ```
00:348EH    F21E            POP ER2
00:3490H    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: 
bn9u: it can be used to get 00 bytes
bn9u: ```
00:33D2H    9A82            L ER10, [ER8]
00:33D4H    F2A6            ADD ER2, ER10
.j_033D6:
00:33D6H    9283            ST ER2, [ER8]
00:33D8H    F82E            POP XR8
00:33DAH    F28E            POP PC```
this gadget is really useful, it is usually written as
`[er8]+=er2`
bn9u: 
bn9u: 
bn9u: i modified your grid thing to decode it
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: here here
ilovecats4606: i will take poto
ilovecats4606: ok dumped
bn9u: oke
ilovecats4606: ->D-00RanInt#(3
bn9u: and what does the hackstring look like
ilovecats4606: yesss lesgo
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: so its RanInt#(3
ilovecats4606: C2 = RanInt
33= 3
bn9u: https://tenor.com/view/donald-duck-fight-gif-20352662
ilovecats4606: i will find addr
ilovecats4606: mb i was doing smt
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: <@981463678698266664>
bn9u: tell me what you will type in before you do it
bn9u: dump 0x33C2
bn9u: okay
bn9u: seems to be good
bn9u: ```
00:35BAH    F21E            POP ER2
00:35BCH    F28E            POP PC```
bn9u: so cant use that
bn9u: which doesnt seem to exist on real
bn9u: ```
00:3252H    9020            L R0, [ER2]
00:3254H    F21E            POP ER2
00:3256H    FE1F            RT```
bn9u: i found smth useful in emu rom
bn9u: i need a pop er2 gadget
bn9u: 
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: what addr to dump
ilovecats4606: what will help
bn9u: 82 esp != 82 au
bn9u: no
ilovecats4606: what will help
ilovecats4606: bruh
bn9u: no
ilovecats4606: will this helps
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: wait that’s so cool
ilovecats4606: so we got the start of rom
ilovecats4606: ooohhhh
bn9u: the start of rom is 0x0000 yes
what he typed 0xFFF4 is correct, because 0xFFF4 - 0xFFFF is drawn to the indicator line (shift inidicator alhpa M etc) that line is actually 12 bytes long (0x0C is 12 in hex)
then the screen reads after that for 12 bytes a line, 31 lines (372 bytes)
but after 0xFFFF, it overflows to 0x0000, so it starts reading from 0x0000
ilovecats4606: this one
ilovecats4606: huh?
ilovecats4606: and star of rom = 0x0?
bn9u: no?
ilovecats4606: that is likeunstbsle some bytes
ilovecats4606: but that is not start of rom?
bn9u: btw dumping past 0x8000 and in segment 1 will get super complicated, but it is mostly just translating pre made hackstrings used to dump them, to this model
bn9u: the only time you can do no args (default) is in vector table (this)
as it is the true start of the rom
ilovecats4606: ooohhh ok
bn9u: yes, but the -n menas no vector table (by default it treats it as start of rom and auto generates some header stuff) and -s means what address it is starting from (defualt is 0)
ilovecats4606: if i give it binfile with no args it still gives me the asm
ilovecats4606: what use does the addr do
bn9u: Btw it only wants even number for addr  so when choosing addr to dump make sure it is an even number
bn9u: Then in the disas tool (after converting image to bin) do python disas.py -n -s 0x<addr> <bin file>
ilovecats4606: yay
bn9u: Yup
ilovecats4606: 0:2131H
ilovecats4606: 2131
ilovecats4606: ok wait
ilovecats4606: 2137
bn9u: Just google 0x2125 + 0xC
bn9u: 12
ilovecats4606: sorry im dumb
ilovecats4606: what’s 0x0C
bn9u: Yes, and remember that the indicator line basically skips 12 bytes so you need to add 0x0C to the final addr
ilovecats4606: 0:2125H
ilovecats4606: is the addr
ilovecats4606: 2125
ilovecats4606: !=21
ilovecats4606: okkk
ilovecats4606: omg mb
ilovecats4606: the 00 is not
ilovecats4606: oh wait
bn9u: You need to convert % ! (Yes the exclamation mark)
ilovecats4606: where wrong
ilovecats4606: what
bn9u: Naur
ilovecats4606: and it’s reverse
ilovecats4606: 0=30
%=25
ilovecats4606: let me check the map
ilovecats4606: i want to learn :)
ilovecats4606: the addr
ilovecats4606: let me figure out
ilovecats4606: WAIT
ilovecats4606: WAIR
theseat_yt: This one is ->D - 0 0 % !
bn9u: or what did you type in
bn9u: what adr is that
theseat_yt: Rom dump time!
bn9u: (cs15+3 is only available on models with constants, this model doesnt have it so it is like randint( + 80)
bn9u: the last char can be anything, XA means that the lower nibble (4 bits) have to be A
for instance
2:1234H -> 34 12 X2 XX
X2 can be 12 or 32 or 82 or anything, but has to have 2
using 3 is easiest because 3X is the number X
so 34 12 32 30 -> 4 cs15+3 2 0
ilovecats4606: then can’t the last 2 numbers be anything
ilovecats4606: wait if X can be anything
bn9u: so
0:3035H -> 35 30 X0 XX
35 30 X0 XX -> 35 30 30 30 (X can be anything)
then 
35 -> 5
30 -> 0
5 0 0 0
bn9u: and then with your DE BC XA XX, convert it to chars using that table
bn9u: its purely a way to indicate that it is represented in hex
ilovecats4606: whaaaaa
bn9u: H is H, it doesnt mean anything
ilovecats4606: where did the H go
bn9u: X can be anything
bn9u: you can use this aswell
A:BCDEH -> DE BC XA XX
ilovecats4606: not confused at all
ilovecats4606: if the address is 3035H then keys are 5 0 0 0
bn9u: but i want you to know how to convert addresses into keys,
https://github.com/fxesdev/115esp2/blob/main/Token_List.md
if the adress is 0:3035H then the keys are 5 0 0 0
if the key is csXX or cvXX then you cant type those and have to use unstable, if the hex is below 25 then it will be very difficult, because you have to overflow all the way from ranint( 
like that is like 98 additions in unstable byte (~50 seconds per char)
bn9u: skl holiday = time
ilovecats4606: only if u got time tho
ilovecats4606: YAY ty
bn9u: ill get some stuff for you to test
ilovecats4606: rant about romdumps<:trollface:840751694639005747>
bn9u: uhh
bn9u: jk
bn9u: im ranting
ilovecats4606: to do funny spelling
bn9u: its been done so much and the only dmca thing was from a person who was here who had beef with another guy
ilovecats4606: then i can learn the cpu instruction and how it work
ilovecats4606: i just want rom so i can use on emu
ilovecats4606: help dump rom
bn9u: who cares atp
ilovecats4606: i give tutorial to dump rom != rom file
bn9u: user202729 != steveyboi
ilovecats4606: steveyboy?
jsaidoru: you dont want to deal with dcma, do you?
ilovecats4606: sharing is caring <:thumbs:1244684231896993822>
ilovecats4606: why
jsaidoru: just a note dont make the rom public <:trollface:840751694639005747>
bn9u: https://github.com/u68/tangent/blob/main/src/vm.c
bn9u: you can read it urself
theseat_yt: i like your new pfp
bn9u: its free so i dont care
theseat_yt: no offense butI dont think your avatar decoration works very well with your avatar
bn9u: nearrrrrly
bn9u: nearlly
bn9u: naur
bn9u: the adr_of is part of a tool made by the super smart guy called user202729, the tool can calculate gadget sizes and stuff and be able to reference adresses in your own code and easily jump
jsaidoru: wait its already done?
jsaidoru: might actually dump this calculator rom some day <:trollface_big:1278702146560327700>
ilovecats4606: bruh ok
bn9u: you could replace all the pop er0's with 
0:3562H
or whatever and then it just gets harder to read
bn9u: its just a way of representing  gadgets as text
bn9u: its not asm!!!!!!
ilovecats4606: you can write asm 😭 that’s insane ur so good
ilovecats4606: what should i do next then
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: there isnt much use in getting 00 right now tho because i got you guys to dump 0xFFF4 and because the display line is 12 bytes (0x0C) 0x0C + 0xFFF4 = 0x0000 so this is dumping the first 372 bytes of the rom
bn9u: you have to make the whole hackstring without it, and in the hackstring add a number to another number to overflow to 0
eg
0x0101 + 0xFEFF = 0x0000
so if you have this piece of rop:
```
smth:
pop er0
adr_label:
0x0101
[er0] = er0    Set er0 to the data at the address of er0 (0)
pop er2
0xf830         Set er2 to a byte in screen
[er2] = er0    Set that byte in screen to er0
brk

start:
pop er0
0xfeff         Set er0 to feff
pop er2
adr_of adr_label    Set er2 to the address of adr label
[er2] += er0   Add er0(0xfeff to 0x0101)
goto smth      Jump to the subroutine```
ilovecats4606: im scared for bros paragraph 😭
ilovecats4606: without flash?
ilovecats4606: so it is impossible to display the rom 00 segment?
bn9u: thats how hackstrings work, its based on not having a null terminator (00)
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: how to get 00
bn9u: you cant
bn9u: its ascii
ilovecats4606: how type null char
bn9u: 0x3030
bn9u: that is
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: 0
ilovecats4606: `0 0`
bn9u: yes, but you cant type 00
ilovecats4606: so if in the <ad dr> i put `00` is that the first bit of rom
bn9u: the rom is 128kb
and the first 32 kb  can be read through ram[0 - 0x8000]
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> hey i hope ur not too busy right now, i just watned to ask, do you know which addr is the start of ROM segment in ram
ilovecats4606: i dump
ilovecats4606: where is rom start addr
kribit: Wow
ilovecats4606: https://youtu.be/H2NRIHGbKpo
ilovecats4606: nooooo 😭
bn9u: It's useless
bn9u: But
ilovecats4606: amaze
ilovecats4606: wow
bn9u: Yes it did work
ilovecats4606: secret btton
ilovecats4606: hold 1, 0, minus and equal (hold 1 first)
then release only 1 and cos( should appear
kribit: thats so wierd
kribit: lol
ilovecats4606: ???
ilovecats4606: why when i hold 5, then hold 1 3 9, then release 5, 7 is shown on the screen
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664> make sure the camera is 100% flat and the image is straight
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> did it work ? i can try to tkae better pic
ilovecats4606: and i cant click
ilovecats4606: like it just becomes super big
ilovecats4606: bro i want to do it myself but its not working
bn9u: ill try
ilovecats4606: better?
bn9u: yeah idk
ilovecats4606: why????
ilovecats4606: bro the img2bin will randomly do this thing where it makes the window super big
ilovecats4606: will try
bn9u: can you get a better pic with even lighting?
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: ok i take pic now
ilovecats4606: okoko
ilovecats4606: mb
ilovecats4606: oh ok
ilovecats4606: huh
theseat_yt: you do it
theseat_yt: i stuffed it up
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664>
theseat_yt: already up to the d part ill do it
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: ->D - 0 0 % 8 0 0 0...
bn9u: try this
ilovecats4606: big file
bn9u: okay
bn9u: 
theseat_yt: now its coloured properly
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: w ok
theseat_yt: mhm
ilovecats4606: apples oappa
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: i got 31
ilovecats4606: wait i will count pixels
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> is it 31
ilovecats4606: have i been doing the wrong the hwole time
ilovecats4606: bruh what
ilovecats4606: erm
theseat_yt: not 32
theseat_yt: also the aspect ratio of my calculator is 31x96 for some reason
theseat_yt: and you can manually adjust pixels turning them off or on
theseat_yt: It gets all pixels in a black and white image with a specified percentage
ilovecats4606: i will implements into img2bin
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: send
theseat_yt: wrote a script
theseat_yt: chatgpt
ilovecats4606: how
theseat_yt: There is no pixel shadow
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: <@981463678698266664>  does this help?
ilovecats4606: casio needs to implement romdump features in the fx82AU plus ii 3rd
ilovecats4606: ..
ilovecats4606: how can my phone read the qr code perfectly but we need to do about 67 trillion modifications to read romdump
bn9u: the qr code in mode 0 is a raw bitmap
bn9u: dump as qr code is impossible because there is no qr code engine
ilovecats4606: we should make it dump as qr code 😭 efficiancy x100
ilovecats4606: pixel shadoww
ilovecats4606: new qr code
ilovecats4606: we can read so much from this 😭
bn9u: this is vector table btw, it tells us a few addresses like start and a few other things
ilovecats4606: wait let me try to do othis
bn9u: yesssssssw
ilovecats4606: :D
ilovecats4606: bro afk
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244>
theseat_yt: Are these better?
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: what is this 4F44 for ?
ilovecats4606: i think we should dump rom first 👍
bn9u: which shouldnt be to hard to find on emu rom
bn9u: you need shut down addr tho
bn9u: it shouldnt be too hard to find
ilovecats4606: need to display CASIO logo next...
bn9u: what phone do you have
bn9u: try ur best
bn9u: this photo was better
theseat_yt: My camera is crap
bn9u: get a better photo gng
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> <@981463678698266664>
bn9u: aight i wanna see da results
ilovecats4606: 000000
theseat_yt: I literally just got up to this step
theseat_yt: I just did it
ilovecats4606: do it
ilovecats4606: bruh
ilovecats4606: ok i am back
theseat_yt: Only took four attempts 🙃
bn9u: only replace
bn9u: like you cant insert chars before stuff
bn9u: you can only delete chars
bn9u: oh yeah
theseat_yt: I had ->D kW>ph @ and when I went to type the -00 the characters in front of the ->D disappeared
theseat_yt: Wait huh????
ilovecats4606: yeye cool
ilovecats4606: or maybe <@782395167079792691> will beta me to it
theseat_yt: I’ll do it
ilovecats4606: im going to eat dinner ill do this when i come back
bn9u: https://tenor.com/view/lol-gif-11059538064120696238
ilovecats4606: oh my golly goshness
ilovecats4606: 💀 💀 💀 💀
bn9u: did you forget the ->D - 0 0
ilovecats4606: BROOOOOOO
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: thingy
ilovecats4606: wait do i need the d
bn9u: noice
ilovecats4606: ez
theseat_yt: Wait nvm
theseat_yt: Once you get the  KW>hp and my cursor is on the right what do u do
bn9u: if you go 1 higher than 61 then it becomes 00
bn9u: wdym it deleted
ilovecats4606: bro it deleted 💀 wtf
ilovecats4606: i need 61 now right
ilovecats4606: kwhp
ilovecats4606: ok i got
bn9u: kewl
ilovecats4606: on the second part of it
ilovecats4606: wtf i got the infinity symbol 💀
ilovecats4606: ...
ilovecats4606: i got hp>kW
ilovecats4606: NOOO I EXIT TOO EARLY
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: the first one is kW>hP right?
theseat_yt: Oh okay
bn9u: spam slowly until M lights up then press delete 11 times
bn9u: ur pressing right very late and skipping a few
theseat_yt: When do you know if you are at unstable if it doesn’t show up
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: video
ilovecats4606: thats not too bad
ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> explanatiion because once a character is out of the unstable zone, then it doenst change
bn9u: if you do it in wrong order you have to restart
bn9u: remember +50 first then +61
bn9u: gl
ilovecats4606: dw
ilovecats4606: i will do it
bn9u: goto unstable, put ranint in, then keep pressing right to update the char, (and count 61 times) then press left delete to "lock" it in
theseat_yt: So how will we do it?
bn9u: any other would not work
bn9u: you need to use the ranint+61 one
bn9u: there several @'s
theseat_yt: Yeah it’s in unstable
ilovecats4606: i swear i saw it in unstable
ilovecats4606: wait where is @ again
ilovecats4606: i saw @ very early in unstable
ilovecats4606: thats easy
ilovecats4606: waht
ilovecats4606: oh
bn9u: ye
bn9u: actually
bn9u: (this is what F4FF looks like btw)
bn9u: 👍
ilovecats4606: i will send a video
ilovecats4606: i do not see
ilovecats4606: hhhhhhhhhhh
bn9u: it *should* be Kw>Hp
ilovecats4606: bruh i will just refresh to see
ilovecats4606: yeah but
bn9u: yes there is
ilovecats4606: bro what 😭 there is no @
ilovecats4606: it says Pa>mmHg
bn9u: good luck
bn9u: ok
bn9u: the nearest typeable cchar before it is ranint
bn9u: so you need to use unstable
bn9u: this calc does not have it
bn9u: it says cv30 because it is shift 8 3 0 on calcs with conversion units
theseat_yt: All fx82auplusii2nd calcs have it
ilovecats4606: it Doenst say ranint+50
ilovecats4606: bro what 💀
bn9u: it should look like "@"
ilovecats4606: ye
bn9u: ranint+50 is put ranint in unstable and wait 25 seconds
ilovecats4606: you know you can jump to chars in unstable right
bn9u: so u need to use unstable
bn9u: cv30 is for calcs with conversion units enabled (shift 8)
ilovecats4606: ok i willt ry
ilovecats4606: my calculator doesnt even have itttt
bn9u: ->D - 0 0 RanInt+50 RanInt+61
ilovecats4606: No character
ilovecats4606: F4 FF
ilovecats4606: wait i look at the charsheet
ilovecats4606: which characters is 0xFFF4
ilovecats4606: very headache inducin
ilovecats4606: you should try do it on the img2bin
theseat_yt: Yeah
ilovecats4606: thats !!
theseat_yt: Merry Christmas
ilovecats4606: just tell me which character
bn9u: you need to do unstable byte for 12 business days
bn9u: but leik
bn9u: i want you do dump 0xFFF4
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> what address should i dump
ilovecats4606: The design is very human
ilovecats4606: introducing click2bin. No more image shenanigans
bn9u: u probably did smth wrong
theseat_yt: so `→D-00!!` just crashes the calculator?
ilovecats4606: ok
theseat_yt: im doing `→D-00!!` now
ilovecats4606: oh whenever the window rerenders it breaks it bruhuhuh
ilovecats4606: overly complicated resizing but it works im happy
ilovecats4606: why not its the best
theseat_yt: why do you use discord light mode 😭
ilovecats4606: 211?
bn9u: on img2bin
bn9u: <@981463678698266664> try modify line 210
ilovecats4606: ye idk why its a square going to make a better version rq
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: after doing img2bin and using h2b  run this and the start addr will be 0x5763 (0x5757+0xC)
ilovecats4606: just go do ur thing first
ilovecats4606: i was just trying random address
bn9u: !! = 57 57
(swap them around still =)
0x5757
bn9u: ! = 0x57
bn9u: this
ilovecats4606: the thing in dms?
ilovecats4606: ?
bn9u: i was lazy
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: chatgpt code yay
bn9u: refer to the github thing i sent
ilovecats4606: put it into img2bin
ilovecats4606: i want to try dump it myself
ilovecats4606: !!
bn9u: (what were the 2 chars after ->D - 0 0)
bn9u: what address did you dump
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: i gotta do something rq
ilovecats4606: what
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: wait
bn9u: then send it here
bn9u: then run disas.py -n -s (address you dumped + 0x0C) out.bin
ilovecats4606: i meant to dump rom not just get stuff from memory
ilovecats4606: yes ik
bn9u: once you got the hex from the img2bin, put it into this and run it
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> so what should i do for romdump
ilovecats4606: i wanna make it smallerrr
theseat_yt: fullscreen?
ilovecats4606: i might make some code changes bc i can python
ilovecats4606: I cant resize the window
ilovecats4606: outside of the ss
ilovecats4606: i will decrease the contrast
theseat_yt: is the window showing full or is it just outside of the screenshot?
ilovecats4606: so many dots missing
theseat_yt: wdym
ilovecats4606: how did i mess up so badly
theseat_yt: thats a pretty smart way of doing it
bn9u: the background is rendered (formula) then the cursor is drawn on the real screen and then the background rendered again, which overwrites the cursor and makes it dissapear
bn9u: thats how the cursor works
bn9u: the calc code makes a 384 byte screen buffer which is used to create 2 layers total (screen buffer and real screen)
bn9u: but
bn9u: no, it doesnt display from ram actually, and the screen is 1bbp meaning each pixel is 1 bit, the screen has its own dedicated vram region (0xf800 - 0xffff) and it is 16 bytes per row and 32 rows meaning only 512 byte region, and only 12 of those 16 bytes per row actually exist (12*8 = 96 (the amount of pixels per row))
theseat_yt: wait im thinking of bits not bytes im dum
ilovecats4606: mb im stupid
theseat_yt: if the screen diplays 3072 pixels (bytes) of ram, then wouldn't that mean that one image of the ram has just under 3kb??
bn9u: or use the built in math functions and built in line drawing functions to make a spinning cube or smth
bn9u: where you can move around and look around left to right
ilovecats4606: it wil prob be more powerful than my school potato
ilovecats4606: a rendering engine 😭
bn9u: you can kinda make a 3d map by using the abs char in mathio and it gives the illusion of hallways
bn9u: nah, but you might be able to make a rendering engine
ilovecats4606: i dont think it can run doom
bn9u: btw there is only 2 kb of ram total
(0x8000 - 0x8E00)
ilovecats4606: for a second i thought you could edit the rom
ilovecats4606: oh i didnt comprehend
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: oh
ilovecats4606: what???
bn9u: no like it redirects to rom basically
ilovecats4606: it copies the rom to ram
bn9u: how the calc works is that it is accessing ram, but the first 0x8000 bytes of ram are mapped to the start of rom
bn9u: if the adress* is below 0x800, convert the chars into hex through this table, and swap the 2 around, for example, `: 9` is 3A 39 in hex, swap them around, 393A, and you compare that with 8000, and you can see that it is lower
theseat_yt: How do I know if the character is before  `0x8000`?
theseat_yt: oh okay
bn9u: 
bn9u: `->D - 0 0`* 
but it looks at the "raw" representation of AA (0x4141)
theseat_yt: if you type `A` after `-00` like `-00AA` is it looking at the memory address of `A` or the memory address of whatever it is saved as?
bn9u: eg
12345 = 0x3132333435
bn9u: like its in hex, in ascii format
bn9u: and it is kinda stored in hex
bn9u: the A variable is like a 10 byte region in ram
bn9u: wdym?
theseat_yt: is the "A" variable treated as itself or its contents?
bn9u: its in <#840569630950424626> and i modded it to have rich presence
theseat_yt: oh okay
bn9u: eg (-) 9 = 60 39 = 3960H
bn9u: to get the address you swap the 2 bytes
bn9u: refer to https://github.com/fxesdev/115esp2/blob/main/Token_List.md
ilovecats4606: also how bro got the devtools
ilovecats4606: ??
ilovecats4606: .
theseat_yt: What characters are u suggesting?
bn9u: that is actually your hackstring being dsiplayed on the screen
bn9u: lol you need to read data from <0x8000 to get data from rom
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: Nothing very interesting
ilovecats4606: result?
ilovecats4606: ye
theseat_yt: so would I do `-00Ran#Ran#`?
theseat_yt: I think im gonna try Ran#
theseat_yt: thats what i was thinking could happen
ilovecats4606: it might just take the variable addr instead of variable value
ilovecats4606: i dont know how variable interact with thsi
theseat_yt: I have `r` stored as `A`, do you think that would do smth interesting?
ilovecats4606: ask <@759251017287860244> maybe you can help with romdumps
ilovecats4606: and then just use chartable to translate the addresses into chars
ilovecats4606: wherever you want to read
ilovecats4606: idk
theseat_yt: i see that, what should I try and replace it with?
ilovecats4606: you can replace %% with stuff
ilovecats4606: as an example
ilovecats4606: yea so type -00%%
theseat_yt: im up to step 8
ilovecats4606: yea
ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> `121212->D|`
theseat_yt: nvm next step explains it
kribit: LETS GOOOOOO
kribit: HOLY PEAK
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: its not really abt the picture
ilovecats4606: I will do it later i brb in 2 hours
ilovecats4606: maybe i can take another picture?
theseat_yt: tysm
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: oh
bn9u: so there is probably errors
bn9u: when manually adjusting its annoying because the image becomes super big and i cant see like 50 % of the pixels
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: vid
ilovecats4606: i might make a tuto
ilovecats4606: its 2 messages 💀 so big
ilovecats4606: <@895187713261703188> <@782395167079792691> <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: 6. pressing [right] until `->D` is shown. a good way to do it is to line up your equation and cursor like this `45454545<unstable>|` and press [right] every time the cursor flashes. Note that the character will change every cursor flash but only changes display when you press the arrow. `->D` comes after the single capital letters (not bold) like `A` `B`.... and then there is `->A` `->B` and eventually `->D`
7. as soon as you see `->D` press [left] and press [DEL]. Keep pressing [DEL] all the way back to the start of the spam 44 characters (i.e. if you spammed `12` then it should look like `1212121212->D`. If there is another character after `->D` (e.g.`mP` or whatever) then go forward and delete it
8. After that press [-] [0] [0] <ad dr> with <ad dr> being symbols corresponding to address. For example <ad dr> can be %%. It will look like `121212->D-00%%`  (its minus not negative)
9. Spam [0] until the M lights up. A good way to know when its about to light up is when you see unstable, start pressing slower (about 10-13 more presses i think)
10. [ac] [left] [equals]
11. congratulations
ilovecats4606: # How to romdump fx82au plus ii 2nd
0. [shift] [9] [3] [=] [ac]
1. Get illegal variable. You can do this 2 methods:
Method 1: [mode] [2] then press [ac] and then [on] about 0.5secs after, to try and enter STAT submode 0. You have entered it correctly when you press [shift] [1] and you see 5:REG. If you press [on] too early the STAT indicator will not light up, try to enter it again. If you press it too late you will see 5:MinMax, change back to COMP mode with [mode] [1] and try it again.
once you are in STAT submode 0: [shift] [1] [5] [3] [shift] [RCL] [(-)]. This will store `r` into variable `A` (can be any variable but i use A as example). Now go to step 2
Method 2: [shift] [+] [0] [shift] [)] [1] [=] [÷] [9], then spam [(] until end of equation. [=] [ac] [up] [ac] [left] then delete everything except for the `r`. shift] [RCL] [(-)]. This will store `r` into variable `A` (can be any variable but i use A as example). Now go to step 2
2. Enter LineIO Verify. Press [shift] [mode] [2] [mode] [3]
3. Evaluate A [alpha] [(-)]. You will see Math ERROR, that is correct. If you see `A=0` `TRUE` you did it wrong, redo steps above from 0
4. Spam any character(s) 90 times. Then keep spamming SLOWLY until you see `A=0` again. So your cursor should be like `999999|A=0` and | is your cursor
5. Now spam a different 44 character(s). It's used as a marker so you know where it is. For this example i will spam `12` so [1] [2] repeat that 22 times (because each digit is a character.) you should end on `2`
6. Now spam a different character(s). It's used as a marker so you know where the end of the previous spam is. For example i will spam `45` so [4] [5]. Keep spamming until you see a character that is not what you typed. It might disappear, so press [DEL] until you see it again. This is the unstable character. It changes when the cursor flashes and you can pause it from changing if you keep moving the cursor back and forth. We want to get it to `->D` so we keep p
bn9u: so we will have to ditch the mathio mode 68 unless you find another way using some glitch
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: btw we lowk cooked tho, because to do a hackstring that doesnt kill the calculator when you press on, you need to input 01 bytes, and to do that you need unstable for like 3 business days
ilovecats4606: yes because different addr
theseat_yt: hmm thats different
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: thanks!
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: someone else can, i plan on porting the rom window dumper that basically runs this hackstring and auto increments so it dumps the first 32kb to the screen
theseat_yt: would you be able to make a simple, step-by-step guide on how you got the rom dump, from clearing the calculator to the reom dump? I will be able to test then. <@981463678698266664>
ilovecats4606: got it
bn9u: we need to find gadgets to do this:
```
er14 = 0x8DD0
sp = er14,pop er14```
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: instead of %% do FF
bn9u: yeah
ilovecats4606: do i need to do another romdump
bn9u: now we jsut need to be able to set r2
bn9u: this is useful

ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: then mess around with ocnstant
bn9u: and kernel size to 0
bn9u: i ususally set blocksize to max
bn9u: you need to set the params correctly
ilovecats4606: why it look so bad on mine
ilovecats4606: is it good?
ilovecats4606: Done
ilovecats4606: taking ss
ilovecats4606: worked
ilovecats4606: but i need to understand asm more
ilovecats4606: yeah i read it alr
bn9u: read this
ilovecats4606: okok
ilovecats4606: i know like really basic asm and thats it
bn9u: (the lowest address you can type without unstable)
ilovecats4606: you can read asm thats so cool
bn9u: it shud dump 372 bytes at 0x2531
ilovecats4606: ye
bn9u: so ->D - 0 0 % % 0 0 0 0 0 0...
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: i do %%?
bn9u: so try ->D - 0 0 <ad dr>
and <ad dr> being % %
then spam 0's until m lights up blah blah blah
bn9u: now we just need to do this for more adresses
bn9u: the only "useful" thing here is pop er0

ilovecats4606: oh well
ilovecats4606: yeah i cant get it to work for me lol
theseat_yt: this should be rotated well
ilovecats4606: interesting
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: for the params
bn9u: do image.png 96 31
bn9u: 
ilovecats4606: what program bro use
bn9u: ye
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> you need to rotate it but this is cropped very well
ilovecats4606: thats some 01010101101010101010101001010 right there
theseat_yt: '
ilovecats4606: ww ok
bn9u: that is good
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> work?
theseat_yt: wow that is good enough i thinl
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: i need better
bn9u: nah
ilovecats4606: i can try to take a better one
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> did it work?
theseat_yt: to decrease the pixel shadow, set the contrast to the lowest
bn9u: pixel shadow really confuses the program
bn9u: 
bn9u: and try to get the light to be as straight down
bn9u: doesnt really matter
ilovecats4606: 😭
theseat_yt: if you want I can type the 1's and 0's out by hand
ilovecats4606: i have bad quality camera
theseat_yt: move your phone back and zoom in
bn9u: ill try it
bn9u: the last one is the best
bn9u: they are too blurry, try center the camera lens right above the screen, i sometimes stack books to hold the phone
ilovecats4606: any of these good
ilovecats4606: ❌ dump rom challenge
✅ heic challenge
theseat_yt: use this windows app for future reference
theseat_yt: https://ixpeering.dl.sourceforge.net/project/simple-heic-convert/v0.1.0/simple-HEIC-PNG-windows-x64.exe?viasf=1
ilovecats4606: here is some
ilovecats4606: ?
theseat_yt: thats hevc
bn9u: ty
ilovecats4606: i will use online convertor
bn9u: wtf
i have to pay money to view thosee pics
theseat_yt: to remove the warp on iphone, you can move your phone back and zoom in
ilovecats4606: use convertor or smt
ilovecats4606: idk
ilovecats4606: just
ilovecats4606: yeah iphone
bn9u: heic?
ilovecats4606: 💀 whoops
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: 
bn9u: its not really that, its the fish eye and  how the left side is a lot darker than the right'
theseat_yt: increase the contrast?
bn9u: nah i need as little pixel shadow as possible
theseat_yt: does this help?
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: ok wait im trying to get it
ilovecats4606: ok i will do that thingy
ilovecats4606: ?
ilovecats4606: i get out of m68
ilovecats4606: so the same thing?
ilovecats4606: let me try
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: then we get mroe gadgets
bn9u: and try other addr,
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: and disas it
bn9u: then we decode it
bn9u: straight camera etc
bn9u: do this, but get the best pic you can, like no dust on the screen and even lighting etc
ilovecats4606: how to do this
bn9u: we need to set 80F9 to C2
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: emulator offset?
ilovecats4606: how hackstring?
bn9u: i think it should become mode 68 mathio if you set it to that, you need to use a hackstring
ilovecats4606: what is mode c2?
ilovecats4606: c2
ilovecats4606: wtf
bn9u: we need to set mode to C2
ilovecats4606: br
bn9u: naur
ilovecats4606: will it still be in mode68
ilovecats4606: can i just change it to mathio
ilovecats4606: 💀 bruh what
bn9u: you need to get mathio mode 68 somehow
ilovecats4606: okokk
bn9u: wait
ilovecats4606: rotated
ilovecats4606: but like
ilovecats4606: i get that small L
ilovecats4606: and when i press fraction
ilovecats4606: nothing appear on screen
ilovecats4606: when i press mixfrac
ilovecats4606: bro
bn9u: wdym
ilovecats4606: deonst show in mode68
ilovecats4606: but
ilovecats4606: yeah ik
bn9u: (shift frac)
ilovecats4606: in mode68
ilovecats4606: it doesnt show
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: type 4 mixed fractions (yknow the 3 square one) and put 1 in every square
bn9u: do this
bn9u: okay okay
ilovecats4606: doesnt emurom have junk stuff tho
ilovecats4606: 😭
ilovecats4606: div so approx 501
ilovecats4606: the emurom is 128kb
ilovecats4606: totalynce carries
ilovecats4606: we dumped 372 bytes of rom :D
theseat_yt: noice
bn9u: lol wait a bit
ilovecats4606: im in mode68
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: yay
ilovecats4606: FIRST TRYYY
ilovecats4606: i will reset calc and enter mode68 now
ilovecats4606: bruh ok
bn9u: lol that mode is so bugged, pressing on resets the whole calc so no
bn9u: i have a method on my other pc rq
ilovecats4606: wait i got it in the egpytain mode will that help
bn9u: then overflow and reach variable area and get those chars into the hackstring
theseat_yt: awwww
bn9u: then store into a variabke
bn9u: the concept is this:
get mathio control chars into lineio
then goto lineio and restore the history, then you can get chars like **A B C D E F**
ilovecats4606: dump rom first 👍
ilovecats4606: 😭
bn9u: we aint doing bad apple rn
bn9u: kinda, it will be difficult because you will need to use a data loader, (this ahckstring method only allows 100 bytes of "code"
ilovecats4606: wait this is insane tho
ilovecats4606: it will not look bad on 96*32
ilovecats4606: wait if we dump rom i can code tetris
theseat_yt: ty
bn9u: 96 * 32
ilovecats4606: 4k ultra hd 240hz 3ms response time
ilovecats4606: 4k
theseat_yt: whats the resolution on the calculator screen?
ilovecats4606: dude this craze
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: afaik yeah, it sucks, but the more rop stuff we get you can actually enter mode 68 by doing a hackstring
ilovecats4606: no other way to enter without the on equals?
ilovecats4606: brooo
bn9u: it involves mathio mode 68 stuff
ilovecats4606: 🗿
bn9u: i need to remember how to do it
ilovecats4606: how weirdstuff
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: wierd stuff
ilovecats4606: which one easier
bn9u: ur gonna have to do some weird stuff unless you want to do unstable char for like 20 minutes
ilovecats4606: !!!
ilovecats4606: PROGRESS ROMDUMP
bn9u: lemme try smth
ilovecats4606: THATS CRAZY
ilovecats4606: WAIT BUT
bn9u: yes but only like 372 bytes
ilovecats4606: WAIT SO IT ROMDUMP???
bn9u: it read 372 bytes from addr 0:3030
ilovecats4606: what does this mean???
ilovecats4606: wait
theseat_yt: OMG DUMP WOOO
bn9u: this is epico
bn9u: i got it right
theseat_yt: WHATTT
ilovecats4606: ?????
bn9u: YESSS
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244>
theseat_yt: oooh?
ilovecats4606: romdump?
ilovecats4606: what is this
ilovecats4606: woah
ilovecats4606: okoko
ilovecats4606: spam 0 till m ac left
bn9u: yes perfect
ilovecats4606: like this?
ilovecats4606: you said type F or something and i was so confused
ilovecats4606: you could have just said "get ->D with unstable"
bn9u: but to get the ->D
ilovecats4606: okok
ilovecats4606: than your paragraph
ilovecats4606: dude that makes way more sense
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: yo
bn9u: <@981463678698266664>

ilovecats4606: what do
ilovecats4606: ok i am back
user11111110301: Sorry i wasn't aware of markdown
user11111110301: Original explanation :
303### some idea about gadget finding 

* Example gadget '÷-00' correspond to '4f 2d 30 30' which point to '0:2d4fh' which prints 3 lines of string to the screen.
* Now, to actually verify that '0:2d4fh +/- 1' is the start of the multi line print function we'll decrease the address by one to get '0:2d4eh' ( × - 0 0 ).
* If it still prints 3 lines, we continue decreasing the address by 1 until we reach an address that will no longer execute the print function.
* If it doesn't print 3 lines or it doesn't print at all, it means '0:2d4f +\- 1 is the start of the function.
* When we reach the address that doesn't print lines , we increment the address by 1 so that we reach the last address that worked, and that is the start of the function.

###Example of  start of a function 
`
printnlines:
0:2d??h.             ;The ?? is because we don't know the start address 
0:2d??+2h.        ;The instructions are 2bytes long 
0:2d??+4h.        ;

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; some instructions
0:2d4eh.            ;
0:2d4fh.            ;This is where you guys usually start executing the print from
0:2d50h.           ; another command 
0:2d52h.           ; another command 
`
i use 0:2d??h because we don't know where the function starts, if you keep decreasing the address until it doesn't print, the address after the address that doesn't print is the start address of the function.

@Chi Mex
user11111110301: LLet's break down the concept of gadget finding and function identification:

*Gadget Finding*

You're looking for specific byte sequences (gadgets) that correspond to particular functions or behaviors in code. For example, the gadget `÷-00` corresponds to the bytes `4f 2d 30 30`, which point to the address `0:2d4fh`. This address prints 3 lines of string to the screen.

*Identifying Function Start*

To determine if `0:2d4fh` is the start of the function, you'll:

1. Decrease the address by 1 to `0:2d4eh` and test if it still prints 3 lines.
2. Continue decreasing the address until it no longer prints or prints differently.
3. When it breaks, increment the address by 1 to find the last working address, which is likely the start of the function.

*Example*

The function `printnlines` might look like this:
printnlines:
  0:2d??h  ; unknown start address
  0:2d??+2h  ; 2-byte instructions
  0:2d??+4h  ; 
  ; some instructions
  0:2d4eh  ; 
  0:2d4fh  ; prints 3 lines
  0:2d50h  ; another command
  0:2d52h  ; another command

By decreasing the address until the function breaks, you'll find the start address of `printnlines`.

This technique helps identify function boundaries and understand code behavior.

Is there a specific aspect you'd like me to clarify or expand on?
user11111110301: 2f 30 30 30 
I don't know what character is 2f
user11111110301: Instead of 30 30 30 30 do
user11111110301: Try decreasing it like
user11111110301: If this still enter diagnostic, it means the address 0:3030h is calling diagnostic mode or is inside the diagnostic function
user11111110301: Okok
ilovecats4606: ok i really gotta sleep gn
ilovecats4606: ?????????
okok
user11111110301: Any of them
ilovecats4606: and like `123456....123456[unstable]` or write over the unstable?
ilovecats4606: so not M
user11111110301: No
user11111110301: 44bytes 0000 then 1234567... Till unstable character
ilovecats4606: is bro going to give me a list from 0000-9999
user11111110301: Tommorow you can try these
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: you can tell me stuff to try and i will reply andn post result tomorrow
ilovecats4606: alr i sleep gn
ilovecats4606: crash with 1234
user11111110301: Maybe 03030h is diagnostic mode
theseat_yt: he did a different combination like 2345 and it crashed
user11111110301: To see if it give a different result
user11111110301: Yes
ilovecats4606: <@1391891552598622360>
ilovecats4606: replace the 0000 here with 1234?
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: ok i start it now
ilovecats4606: i was doign smt else
ilovecats4606: yes wait brooo
user11111110301: ....
user11111110301: 
ilovecats4606: 1 secc
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: ok one more before i sleep
user11111110301: T .
Replace 0000 with 1234
theseat_yt: oki
ilovecats4606: you can tell me stuff to try and i will reply andn post result
theseat_yt: gn
ilovecats4606: i am going to sleep now
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: It will enter the diagnostic mode
ilovecats4606: nothing
user11111110301: Wdym
ilovecats4606: ac = line
ilovecats4606: diagnostic
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: wait doing it
user11111110301: What wa the result
ilovecats4606: ww
theseat_yt: smae
ilovecats4606: aest me 10pm
ilovecats4606: i will sleep soon aswell
ilovecats4606: do this tmr
ilovecats4606: go sleep
ilovecats4606: oh you nz time
user11111110301: Pm
bn9u: It's 1 am
bn9u: Get cursor on the left of the ->D then do delete until you reach the 44rth char
ilovecats4606: ?
user11111110301: What the results
ilovecats4606: i do this now
ilovecats4606: yeah i got Ran#F idk wtf im doing
ilovecats4606: then i do thsi
ilovecats4606: lemme do totalynce thingy first
ilovecats4606: bruh how to do this 😭
ilovecats4606: i think totalynce gone
user11111110301: Instead of the "divide minus 0 0 " part for spelling after typing 44characters , enter 0000 then divide minus 0 0 then do until M
ilovecats4606: my cursor is `->D|Ref(`
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244>
user11111110301: Can you try something
theseat_yt: okau
user11111110301: Ok
ilovecats4606: they mean that in the final hackstring we dont include unstable byte but we get the chars from unstbale
ilovecats4606: sp offset 44 byte
user11111110301: So the sp should be at 0:8d9ch
theseat_yt: don't those statements contradict, or are you implying that we are to get them some other way
ilovecats4606: type 45 till M then get to unstable del 11 time
ilovecats4606: 44 chars done
ilovecats4606: type 12 44char
ilovecats4606: ok im at |A now
ilovecats4606: 🗿
user11111110301: Except you need character from the unstable character
user11111110301: You must not get to the unstable character,
ilovecats4606: unstable is before M
theseat_yt: i think
theseat_yt: the hackstring may me 100 bytes, but to get to the unstable character you need to repeat until you get M
user11111110301: Than pad 4times
ilovecats4606: i am not confused at all
user11111110301: Yeah
ilovecats4606: ok so step 3. unstable byte is ->D then i type F?
user11111110301: It is not necessary as far as the hack string is 100bytes complete
theseat_yt: gl
theseat_yt: oki
ilovecats4606: ok i will try to do it wish me luck guys
ilovecats4606: dont confuse me more 😭
ilovecats4606: to get to unstable
theseat_yt: ?
ilovecats4606: chatgpt style
user11111110301: Type till M part is not necessary
theseat_yt: would you like me to make a tutorial in my style?
ilovecats4606: okokok
ilovecats4606: yea
ilovecats4606: wait no i read the whole thing
bn9u: so when you are deleting the chars before the ->D you will see where 44 chars is
ilovecats4606: OH its so ik 44 char
ilovecats4606: wait so it doenst matter which chars just has to be differnet
bn9u: then for the rest do 45454545
bn9u: lets say for the 44 chars you do 1212121212
user11111110301: This will take long before the rom is dumped
ilovecats4606: type 44 chars switch to other chars
bn9u: which step
ilovecats4606: i am SO CONFUSED
ilovecats4606: 1. Type 44 chars
2. switch to other chars spam until M lights up (like just lights up, if you goto far delete until it goes back and then type 1 more so it lights up) delete 11 times
3. then to get F+4 (it will look like ->D if you do it right, type F, then quickly move your cursor left and right so the curesor doesnt flash,
4. then wait until it flashes from on to off, and move your cursor
5. you should now see ->A (dont let it sit there otherwise it will go too high)
6. repeat that letting 1 flash go until you get the char ->D, then make sure your cursor is on the left side of the ->D then quickly delete to get it outside of the unstable byte
7. then keep pressing delete until it sits right at that 44 char start, (you will see becasue you switched to using other spam chars)
8. then do - 0 0 then spam 0's until m lights up then ac left equals
bn9u: gl
ilovecats4606: nvm its asking me to type F i will just read your tutorial
ilovecats4606: chatgpt strategy
bn9u: its just that as soon as you get ->D after typing F do left delete to "lock" it in
ilovecats4606: a
bn9u: well you seem to understand unstable byte very well you should be fine
ilovecats4606: hmm lemme read
ilovecats4606: is your enter key broken 😭
ilovecats4606: i didnt even read that far
ilovecats4606: no like
ilovecats4606: 😭
ilovecats4606: BRO
bn9u: i meant you need ->D instead of **D** my bad
ilovecats4606: candyland tobu
bn9u: best music choice
ilovecats4606: very tutorial indeed
ilovecats4606: https://youtu.be/_kPq103Rp3g
ilovecats4606: i have tutorial
ilovecats4606: I have vid of unstable
theseat_yt: line breaks do exist
bn9u: dw ill see if i can get a vid of unstable
ilovecats4606: ok
ilovecats4606: 😭 wtf
bn9u: ok 44 chars then switch to other chars spam until M lights up (like just lights up, if you goto far delete until it goes back and then type 1 more so it lights up) delete 11 times, then to get F+4 (it will look like ->D if you do it right, type F, then quickly move your cursor left and right so the curesor doesnt flash, then wait until it flashes from on to off, and move your cursor, you should now see ->A (dont let it sit there otherwise it will go too high) repeat that letting 1 flash go until you get the char ->D, then make sure your cursor is on the left side of the ->D then quickly delete to get it outside of the unstable byte, then keep pressing delete until it sits right at that 44 char start, (you will see becasue you switched to using other spam chars) then do - 0 0 then spam 0's until m lights up then ac left equals
bn9u: there is only ver a afaik of this mdoel
ilovecats4606: mine same as that
theseat_yt: Do different calculators have the same VerA version?
ilovecats4606: if it is one step closer to dumping rom i do it 👍
ilovecats4606: wait that means i have to type all the way then press cursor and get the timing then del all the way back
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: nah
bn9u: for this one ur gonna need unstable
ilovecats4606: ? emurom
bn9u: oof
bn9u: 0x2D4A
bn9u: yes but not 82 au plus ii
ilovecats4606: how to use it?
user11111110301: You must use the emu to actually find gadgets
ilovecats4606: i got telecomadmin casioemu can i find stuffs in it?
ilovecats4606: yeah
theseat_yt: what does yh mean i forgor
bn9u: 0x1B2 offset
ilovecats4606: which is really really cool of them and they deserve a cookie
bn9u: 44D8 is emu 4326 is real (115esp2)
ilovecats4606: BUT instead of the random digits and 10 00 totalynce is looking through emurom and finding stuffs
ilovecats4606: tutorial here
kribit: ill just wait for tutorial frfr
theseat_yt: uoa
user11111110301: Yh
ilovecats4606: can exec random hackstrings and stuff in the calc
ilovecats4606: so found way for ace/rop or whatever
ilovecats4606: oh forgot
ilovecats4606: <@1391891552598622360> is this what you wnat
user11111110301: No
bn9u: so im using real esp2 difference
bn9u: i dont thing esp offset works well on esp2
user11111110301: Yh
bn9u: okay
ilovecats4606: interest
user11111110301: Ok
bn9u: yea
ilovecats4606: is it through emu
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> how do you even find this
user11111110301: Great work
theseat_yt: that can happen
ilovecats4606: before i did ur strat and all the symbols at the top lit up with ac
bn9u: 100%
ilovecats4606: ye
theseat_yt: does ac make a line?
ilovecats4606: yes
bn9u: hmmm
ilovecats4606: if i press ac whats the chance i crassh
bn9u: thats the 6 menu
theseat_yt: oh so its like the one I discovered
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: yes
ilovecats4606: yes
theseat_yt: the shift 7 on menu?
bn9u: show me what it didd
ilovecats4606: i now have 3 ways to open menu
bn9u: wud
ilovecats4606: it work
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244>
ilovecats4606: 😱
ilovecats4606: DEBUG
ilovecats4606: DEBUG
ilovecats4606: then spam 0000 until M after?
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: instead of `2000`?
bn9u: (everything else 0 still)
bn9u: can you try ÷ - 0 0
bn9u: so in reality you typed 2300
bn9u: btw how the last 2 chars work is like this:
4 is 0x34, and it gets anded with 1 so it becomes 0, and the last one is meaningless
ilovecats4606: 4lines spelling tut
1. verif lineio overflow

1. get into lineio verif overflow. For this example i refer to A=0
2. spam 90 characters and then slowly type more until you see A=0 again. So the cursor should be at e.g. `9999999|A=0` | is cursor
3. [0] 44 times
4. [2]
5. spam [0] until M lights up
6. [ac] [left] [equals]
theseat_yt: welp now u know
kribit: breuh
ilovecats4606: freeze 🤡
ilovecats4606: will that show
ilovecats4606: with 2345
ilovecats4606: if i replace 2000
ilovecats4606: wait so
bn9u: that means it is 44 offset then
kribit: 🔥
bn9u: perfect
bn9u: ahh
ilovecats4606: this
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: what did you type
theseat_yt: guacamole
kribit: omg it work
bn9u: ?
ilovecats4606: holy banana
theseat_yt: wow
ilovecats4606: 4lines omg
ilovecats4606: wait i show
ilovecats4606: works with 1 2
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: because i suspect that sp offset might not be right
bn9u: see if that makes spelling
bn9u: try 44 __0's__ then 2000 then spam __0's__ until M lights up ac left =
bn9u: try dis
bn9u: hmm
bn9u: umm
bn9u: argh
ilovecats4606: freeze
bn9u: i should make a thing in info
bn9u: we kinda standardized buttons
bn9u: minus
ilovecats4606: minus or negative
theseat_yt: hmm okay
bn9u: its surprisingly old
bn9u: its not new
bn9u: we just trying some stuff
ilovecats4606: try new strategy
ilovecats4606: okok
theseat_yt: what is the current problem that needs solving?
bn9u: yes, now type 44 numbers
ilovecats4606: i am at `99999|A`
ilovecats4606: any char or 0
bn9u: yes
ilovecats4606: 44 char from A=0?
bn9u: (involves getting mathio chars in lineo)
bn9u: or using weird stuff like variables but that is really annoying to do
bn9u: and u have to use unstable
bn9u: like any cs or cv chars u cant on this model
bn9u: same for all calcs, except a lot of chars u cant type on calcs
ilovecats4606: same for all calc?
theseat_yt: care to fill me in on what I have missed?
bn9u: i was using this thing
bn9u: https://github.com/fxesdev/115esp2/blob/main/Token_List.md
ilovecats4606: how convert from bytes to button calc ?
ilovecats4606: okokok
ilovecats4606: mb i was doing smt
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: <@981463678698266664>
bn9u: 44 chars [squaredeg] [-] [0] [0] [0] [0] (then spam 0's until M lights up) then ac left equals
bn9u: squredeg is [° " '] button btw
bn9u: try this
bn9u: okay
bn9u: squaredeg - 0 0
bn9u: 5C 2D 30 30
bn9u: 0x2D5C
bn9u: so - 0x1A0
bn9u: 0:2EFC is emu
ilovecats4606: 😱
bn9u: sewn
ilovecats4606: does that mean can do hackstrings now?
ilovecats4606: woah
bn9u: 0x1A0 offset
bn9u: 0:30D2 is emu and 0:2F32 is real
bn9u: okay
ilovecats4606: i want to learn how it works
ilovecats4606: how do you know all this stuffs 😭
ilovecats4606: okkok cool
bn9u: yes
bn9u: a little piece of code
ilovecats4606: and isint the RENDER thingy used to dump rom/display things on screen
bn9u: an address
ilovecats4606: what is a "gadget"?
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: then try that
bn9u: apply to 2nd edtion
bn9u: get the offset
bn9u: ill compare ont he emu rom
bn9u: 0:2F32 is the real render gadget addr on the first edition
bn9u: i cnat find it but leik, ill try smth
ilovecats4606: okok tyyy
bn9u: im trying to get the "magic offset" an offset that applies to most calcs to convert somje addresses in emu rom to real rom
ilovecats4606: because emulator rom is different to real ?
ilovecats4606: what are you doing with the emulator rom? I just want to learn how it can help with real
ilovecats4606: interesting
bn9u: i think its pulling from er2 which by default is the start of the formula so i think like <16 chars> <pad byte> <16 chars> ...
ilovecats4606: in this spelling does it pull the `202020` from what i typed? does that mean that we can replace wherever it is ?
bn9u: ok thanks
ilovecats4606: i have you want? can dm
ilovecats4606: 
bn9u: lemme get the emu rom rq
ilovecats4606: yo it work 3 lines
bn9u: ye
ilovecats4606: 0202 freeze i try 2020
bn9u: try spam 2020 instead
bn9u: becuase cursor becomes full rectangle if there are 90 or more chars in the input buffer'
bn9u: when you do ac left, the whole thing should be at least 100 chars long for overflow to work, if you typed too much, it can cut it off, (easy to tell by the cursor type, if it is a full rectangle then yes its fine, if just line then no not fine)
ilovecats4606: should i try again?
ilovecats4606: oops i went a bit over M into the Ref(Ref(Ref section and ac left equals froze
ilovecats4606: holy moly
bn9u: ancient photo from my chromebook
ilovecats4606: okokok\
bn9u: yes, but trial and error can get it
ilovecats4606: ookokok\
bn9u: yes
bn9u: you dont need to ue 9's btw, i usually spam 2 buttons that are next to each other lkike 7878 etc
ilovecats4606: then i spam 0202 till M
ilovecats4606: 4linespelling need romdump?
ilovecats4606: so the `9999|A=0` thing?
bn9u: and usually 3 lines sometimes 4 lines
bn9u: and kinda inconsistent
bn9u: its weird
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: yesss
ilovecats4606: this calculator can spelling????
bn9u: try this, once you get to the formula, spam 0202 until you get m and ac left =
bn9u: i remember some spelling thing, where it used 0202 or 2020
bn9u: hmm
bn9u: you did everything correctly
ilovecats4606: it is up now
bn9u: it probably has some weird upscaling thing
ilovecats4606: why is it 4k i swear i set 1080p
ilovecats4606: come back in 2 minute
ilovecats4606: oops
bn9u: It's private
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> https://youtu.be/7qImF7kvZAY
ilovecats4606: i will show a video to verify i do it right
bn9u: Yes
ilovecats4606: the k is unstables
bn9u: Hmmm
ilovecats4606: frozen again
ilovecats4606: yes i did
bn9u: Yes, but instead of the 2 random characters and the 1 0 or 0 0 do 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 and then spam until m lights up ac left equals
ilovecats4606: doing it now
ilovecats4606: im doing it like this is it right?
ilovecats4606: okok
bn9u: Okay try this, 44 characters, 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0, then spam until m etc
ilovecats4606: always frozen calcs
ilovecats4606: with the sp offset
ilovecats4606: what do i do???
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: I can help now
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: Used to a long time ago, and borrowed from my old skewl
theseat_yt: buy one off ebay its a lot cheaper
ilovecats4606: also the sp offset thing i cant get anything cool to show up just freezing calc
ilovecats4606: dont you already have it?
ilovecats4606: ~~if dump rom dont need to buy the real calc~~
bn9u: Also ts too expensive
bn9u: Mode 68 isn't really useful on this model tho
bn9u: Not that I know of rn
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> is ther any other way to enter mode 68 without having to press equals on method
ilovecats4606: am i doing  the sp offset thing right
ilovecats4606: ok
bn9u: thats just some weird stuff that r does, you need to dump the rom to fully understand r for each model
ilovecats4606: <@759251017287860244> is this right? cause i am not gaetting anything only calculator hangs
ilovecats4606: I also got it to equal something like 8 scientific notation of x10 or something but id dint take
ilovecats4606: stat submode 0
ilovecats4606: ???
bn9u: It is the fx 375 es A
kribit: What is PreAns button
kribit: What calc is that
kribit: Yeah
bn9u: These 2 buttons
kribit: K
bn9u: Ans is 1 char, x10 is 1 char
kribit: <@759251017287860244> does ans and x10 count as one character or 3
ilovecats4606: <@895187713261703188> <@782395167079792691>
ilovecats4606: # bruteforce rop/ace/idk what its called tutorial
pam like 90 characters and then slowly type more until you see ur formula again (iirc verif overflow is like A=0) so then type 44 0's then 2 random characters, either a 1 or a 0, then another 0, then spam until you see the M indicator light up, then press ac left equals and see if anything cool happens and write down the 2 random chars
By <@759251017287860244> 
1. get into lineio verif overflow. For this example i refer to A=0
2. spam 90 characters and then slowly type more until you see A=0 again. So the cursor should be at e.g. `9999999|A=0` | is cursor
3. [0] 44 times
4. then type 2 random characters
5. then type either [0] [0] or [1] [0]. It should look like this: `...0000000<2randomchars><00 OR 10>`
6. spam characters until M lights up
7. [ac] [left] [equals]
8. If something cool comes up send the 2 random chars and the segment number (whether it was `00` or  `10`
It's basically typing in a random address in the hopes of getting something cool
kribit: Also you don’t have to do step 8 because you reset I thought
kribit: Step 2 has always given me panic attacks
ilovecats4606: glitch mathio tut


1. [shift] [9] [3]
2. this is the hardest bit. Press [=] and [on] at the same time. If it goes back to calculation screen with a 0 in the bottom right, move on. if no 0, then go back to step1
3. [2] [exp] [2] [=] (it will look like 2^(2 then eval)
4. [shift] [9] [1] [=] [ac]
5. [up] [left] [del] [right] [del] [left] [del] [right] [right]
6. [x10] [ans] in the box till M light up
7. [ac] [left] [equals] wait for error screen [ac]
8. [mode] [1] [shift] [mode] [1] [1]
9. type random fractions and sqrts
ilovecats4606: how to get a lot of SpecialBox
1. [1][div][1]
2. [sqrt] until end of equation
3. [right] 13 times. If you press it one more time it should jump back to the start of the equation
4. press [sqrt] for however many more SpecialBox you want. e.g. if you want 2, press [sqrt] once. If you want 3, press [sqrt][right][sqrt]
5. eval
6. [right] then delete all until you see the first box
7. [left] you will reach the end of equation, and you will see box freeed from its root. so just delete everything except the box
kribit: Can you teach rop
kribit: I mean you are right and glorious and first is better
kribit: First is top 10 poopy calculator of all time
kribit: Nuh uh second is alpha in every way
ilovecats4606: pls teach rop ??
bacteria2331: if you are a first edition chad then you should use <#839762460796780544> and see the pinned messages
kribit: 
kribit: I did this on first edition and it gave me a light show lmao
ilovecats4606: bro where calcbot

ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> <@895187713261703188>
ilovecats4606: get arbitary characters in comp (NO OVERFLOW)
1. Your evaluated expression must have scientific notation. 
An easy way to get this for example is [1][x10][1][1], then evaulate
2. Copy the answer to equation section
ilovecats4606: remember
ilovecats4606: i remmeber
ilovecats4606: i remmebre now
ilovecats4606: found it a few days ago
ilovecats4606: bro there was one to enter arbitary chars in comp but i forgor
ilovecats4606: ??
theseat_yt: ah yep
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: anyways idk much more i will need <@895927297184522251> or someone to teach me more (beubeu plssss 🙏 )
ilovecats4606: :D
ilovecats4606: ok so its a bit hard to get at first. Press mode and then [2] to get into stat menu. normally ofc you have to select, but if you press [AC] and then [on] about 0.5sec after then you can enter the STAT submode 0.
you have entered it when STAT lights up, and you press [shift] [1] and then you see 5:REG
if stat does not light up you pressed [on] too quick. if stat lights up but in the STATmenu 5:MinMax then you pressed [on] too late so retry.
then in 5:REG ou will see 5 characters. The one we are looking for is `r`. so the way to obtain is [shift][1][5][3] then you can store that into variable and then lineio verif and overflow
theseat_yt: <@759251017287860244> ban them
theseat_yt: whats stat submode 0`r`?
ilovecats4606: its wayy faster lol
ilovecats4606: you dont need theta
ilovecats4606: bro you can enter VERIF basic overflow with stat submode 0 `r`
theseat_yt: idk
kribit: Why does this server get botted so much
theseat_yt: oh okay ty
sushi2627: but i can delete messages
sushi2627: nvm i cant ban or kick people
theseat_yt: ty!
sushi2627: sure
theseat_yt: also love the music its beatiful
theseat_yt: wow thats smart
theseat_yt: wait howww
kribit: <@895927297184522251> can you give me perms to pin stuff in this channel
kribit: My calculator isn’t turning on<:whyyy:1179085658850074815>
ilovecats4606: (never)
ilovecats4606: wait for the video for dump rom
kribit: Also get someone to damn give me you and seat pin permission in this channel
kribit: Gonna try it on 1st edition

ilovecats4606: omg
ilovecats4606: i got unstable byte changing
kribit: This is getting good
kribit: I NEED to find my 2nd edition
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: and turning on the sto
theseat_yt: so the cursor was probably sent too high
theseat_yt: and all the options were on
theseat_yt: when I exited the ace menu
theseat_yt: I had a line show up at the very top
theseat_yt: wow
ilovecats4606: how
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: How to get a line:
1.  type [1] [÷] [1]
2. press [√] until you cannot any more (or 13 times)
3. press [=]
4. press [left arrow]
5. press [DEL] 17 times, or until you have reached the left of the box
6. press [left arrow]
7. press [DEL] 14 times, or until the box is the only symbol left
8. press [right arrow] 2 times. if the cursor doesn't move on the second press, you have done it correctly.
9. type [SHIFT][fraction] 8 times
10. type [right arrow] 2 times
11. press [DEL] until you get a line

press on to reset.
ilovecats4606: lmfaooo
theseat_yt: i tried to change it to comp and it turned off lmao
ilovecats4606: lmao
theseat_yt: just crashed it lmao
ilovecats4606: not the equation
ilovecats4606: but its the state of the cal
ilovecats4606: idk
theseat_yt: can you save it as a variable?
ilovecats4606: in this state
ilovecats4606: Its very easy to crash calculator
theseat_yt: okay
ilovecats4606: now play around but its super unstable
ilovecats4606: nice
theseat_yt: i got this.
theseat_yt: i did ac left = then got syntax error
theseat_yt: I got M again
ilovecats4606: But its [ac] [left] [equals] ERROR [left] [ac]
ilovecats4606: like i dont htink it would have worked cause freeze
ilovecats4606: you needed to wait for the error. But even though it freeze i think its fine
theseat_yt: 
ilovecats4606: I am trying to figure out if there is a use to it
ilovecats4606: and do i t again
ilovecats4606: you can try to restart
ilovecats4606: idk incobsistene
ilovecats4606: oh well
theseat_yt: it crashed
ilovecats4606: ac left equals left ac
theseat_yt: i stopped typing
theseat_yt: the M just showed up
ilovecats4606: means you are close
ilovecats4606: keep going utnil m
ilovecats4606: yeah
theseat_yt: a [me] character just showed up
ilovecats4606: yes keep going until M
theseat_yt: I saw the a=0, and I kept going.
ilovecats4606: You will see another A=0 when you type about 96 characters just keep going
ilovecats4606: keep going until M
ilovecats4606: yes
theseat_yt: one I got the math error, I pressed left. This showed the A=0. I typed x10x then ans 3 times without anything showing up. when I pressed x10x again, all the x10x and ans that I had typed then showed up. The M has not lit up yet, I am just confirming that this should happen
ilovecats4606: or the M?
ilovecats4606: what you are typing?
ilovecats4606: what showed up???
theseat_yt: once I got it stuck, and pressed [x10x then ans] 4 times in a row, it showed up on screen
ilovecats4606: if its m you can try ac left = but i didnt think it would be that fast?
ilovecats4606: If its equation just keep going
ilovecats4606: the equation or M?
theseat_yt: when I did x10x ans after 3 presses of each it shows up.
ilovecats4606: Then M will light up [ac] [left][=][left][ac]
ilovecats4606: Nothing will appear utnil you type until a few characters
ilovecats4606: dont delete anything or ac or anything just type into the a=0
ilovecats4606: [x10][ans]
theseat_yt: whats next
ilovecats4606: [left]
theseat_yt: when you get into verify mode and you press a then press = and get math error, what steps do you do
ilovecats4606: ???/
ilovecats4606: After you evaluate theta?
theseat_yt: just double checking
theseat_yt: once you get the math error, what do you do
ilovecats4606: idk
ilovecats4606: it may crash
theseat_yt: I think I did ill do it again
ilovecats4606: right?
ilovecats4606: not just [ac] left] [equals] [ac]
ilovecats4606: You press [ac] [left] [equals] [left] [ac]
theseat_yt: yeah
ilovecats4606: x10 ans?
ilovecats4606: what did you do?
theseat_yt: i did this then it just reset the calc
theseat_yt: works now for some reason
theseat_yt: i got it
ilovecats4606: you can send video
ilovecats4606: and try again?
ilovecats4606: reset
theseat_yt: I did EXACTLY that
ilovecats4606: 
theseat_yt: lmaooo
ilovecats4606: bro is mind reading
ilovecats4606: i did exactly that lmfao
theseat_yt: press settings and press 9mb
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: yeah thats the one im suign
theseat_yt: use this
ilovecats4606: Do i just enter it in the overflow?
theseat_yt: https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor
ilovecats4606: How hackstring work?
ilovecats4606: freecompress org
ilovecats4606: i am using sketchy online chinese website
ilovecats4606: wtf
ilovecats4606: how is a 20sec 1080p 24fps video 55mb
theseat_yt: sure
ilovecats4606: I can send video?
ilovecats4606: the lineio overflow is verify in this calculator
theseat_yt: I am
ilovecats4606: yeah this one need to be in verify
casiotester2k12: I think you're in verify mode
ilovecats4606: did you store theta correctly?
ilovecats4606: you did it wrong then
theseat_yt: it says A=0 true
ilovecats4606: what did bro do
ilovecats4606: ?????
theseat_yt: When i did alpha + a then = it says true
ilovecats4606: You need to type a few characters before it shows on screen
ilovecats4606: press left and you are in overflow
ilovecats4606: = will math error
ilovecats4606: [alpha] [a] [=] [left]
theseat_yt: done
ilovecats4606: then go mode3 verify
theseat_yt: yuh
ilovecats4606: press 2
ilovecats4606: and open setup
theseat_yt: yup
ilovecats4606: Now press AC
ilovecats4606: ok that is correct
ilovecats4606: ok
theseat_yt: so I got oo->A
ilovecats4606: It should say on screen theta->A and answer is blank
casiotester2k12: I have never used this calc before, but i think we can try to do some exploits from other models (Basically just entering their hackstring)
ilovecats4606: so [shift] [sto] [a]
ilovecats4606: After pol(0,1) get the equation then delete everything except for theta. Store in a variable like A
theseat_yt: done
ilovecats4606: first
ilovecats4606: You need to do it in mathio
theseat_yt: I know the pol(0,1) exploit, but I don't know if for lineio
ilovecats4606: how rop?
ilovecats4606: do you know what i should do after getting basic overflow lineio
casiotester2k12: I dont even have the calc
ilovecats4606: Get the theta with Pol(0,1) exploit do you know how?
casiotester2k12: No
ilovecats4606: can you dump rom pls
ilovecats4606: After  [ac] Calculator go black for a second then look like this
casiotester2k12: What yall yapping abt
theseat_yt: oki
ilovecats4606: wait i give tutorail 1 sec
theseat_yt: how do I achieve lineio basic overflow
theseat_yt: found it
theseat_yt: ok
ilovecats4606: You need to press  [=] [Left] [AC]. Press [AC] itself will crash calc (shutdown)
theseat_yt: i lost my calc im looking for it now
ilovecats4606: Steps:
LineIO basic overflow in verif
[x10][ans] until M light up
[AC] [Left] [=] [Left] [AC]
theseat_yt: hmmm
ilovecats4606: Fraction became Int( and the calculator frozen
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: what do i do after i get it
ilovecats4606: if you copy ERROR to equation
ilovecats4606: Eoo/o
ilovecats4606: why casiocalc wikidot not load
ilovecats4606: different method same result
ilovecats4606: i think i did this
jsaidoru: 🤔
ilovecats4606: which button dump rom
ilovecats4606: what to do now?
ilovecats4606: i think i got it
ilovecats4606: hard to explain
ilovecats4606: like i need to press a lot of characters and then it jumps
ilovecats4606: I get `A=0` but like funny thing
jsaidoru: just guessing
jsaidoru: idk about these calculators so
jsaidoru: it should give math error try pressing some buttons if nothing appears then you probably entered basic overflow
ilovecats4606: <@895927297184522251> I followed the steps i got math error and when i press left arrow it say `A=0`
ilovecats4606: or is it a task for me
ilovecats4606: ?? do you know how
jsaidoru: has someone dump the rom of this calc?
ilovecats4606: I cannot get specialbox with lineio
ilovecats4606: is overflow the special box
bacteria2331: LineIO basic overflow is possible on your calc in VERIF mode
bacteria2331: LineIO basic overflow allows you to see what you are typing
bacteria2331: MathIO basic overflow sucks
bacteria2331: VERIF LineIO is the best form of basic overflow on these calcs
ilovecats4606: if i do it can you help me dump
ilovecats4606: what is verif lineio overflow
ilovecats4606: ??
ilovecats4606: beubeu join chat 😱
bacteria2331: <@981463678698266664> you should try getting VERIF LineIO overflow
ilovecats4606: Steps to get ^
Do this above tutorial up to 11 (inclusive)
Get specialbox inside the exponent  (inside 𝒙□)
ilovecats4606: ^
kribit: 🤯
kribit: I think I don’t do any more naplans tho I’m too old 😭
kribit: Omg pls dm
theseat_yt: going into surgery in 30mins wish me luck
ilovecats4606: is not even supported on this calc?
ilovecats4606: but if it gives you the erorr still you can just ac
ilovecats4606: e.g. x10 x10 ans x10 ans... you might get that. just reset
ilovecats4606: if you dont press X10 and ans in order sometimes it does that
ilovecats4606: ??
adriweb: No idea 🤷‍♂️
theseat_yt: ??
lol2302.: memory,render
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: <@186877848731123712> is this something do do with the rom or just a visual artifact
<@981463678698266664>
theseat_yt: <@696362227070009384> what is this?
theseat_yt: 
theseat_yt: how tf did I get a dimension error
theseat_yt: then it crashed
theseat_yt: I just AE'd the clear setup dialouge
theseat_yt: huh i got a cool 'and' block when used as 1and# is returns 1 if it is an odd number
theseat_yt: I got the box, pressed x^ a bunch of times then pressed right 20 times then spammed delete
theseat_yt: dont know if this is useful
theseat_yt: How to gain access to the secret menu (REVISED EDITION):
(start by clearing the calculator: [shift],[9],[3],[=],[ac])

```1. type in 1÷1
2. press "√" until you cannot any more (or 13 times)
3. press =
4. press left arrow once
5. press [DEL] 17 times, or until you have reached the left of the box
6. press left arrow once
7. press [DEL] 14 times, or until the box is the only symbol left
8. press right arrow twice. if the cursor doesn't move on the second press, you have done it correctly.
9. press [fraction] 6 times
10. press right arrow 4 times
11. press [DEL] 4 times. if a new symbol appears to the left, you have done it correctly.
12. press left arrow once
13. press [fraction] once
14. press [DEL] twice```

you should've successfully entered the secret menu
When you press [AC], a line will show up. press [ON] to reset.
steps 14-16 were removed as not necassary.
theseat_yt: thats about 450 clicks
theseat_yt: i checked it twice. on a touchpad
theseat_yt: also the ans x10x one dosent work in the emulator
theseat_yt: lol dont know what I did
theseat_yt: i think i got it at the bottom once
theseat_yt: the line is sometimes at the top, sometimes in the middle
ilovecats4606: The one in order is: CPU verify, display cycle, 3 key then ac
ilovecats4606: I ran some test in debug menu and when I ac'd the line was in middle
ilovecats4606: dms?
theseat_yt: Would you like to join a server that bypasses it?
ilovecats4606: like theres multiple surrounding on how to access Shell while in the exam
ilovecats4606: bro i literally found like so many bugs before and i reported to acara and they just gave me a bot response
ilovecats4606: yes
theseat_yt: have you done it?
ilovecats4606: yes ik it
theseat_yt: i know
ilovecats4606: bro im australian
theseat_yt: Have you ever heard of naplan
theseat_yt: I love pushing software to the limits
theseat_yt: :D yeah
ilovecats4606: :D
ilovecats4606: maybe will dump rom
ilovecats4606: if we press enough random button
theseat_yt: same here lol
ilovecats4606: lmfao
ilovecats4606: press random button
ilovecats4606: oh
theseat_yt: the bin  one
ilovecats4606: the x10 ans?
ilovecats4606: which one
theseat_yt: how the heck did you figure out the one you did
ilovecats4606: and the bin oct stuffs
ilovecats4606: debug menu
ilovecats4606: i had it for 3 years and could only do like
theseat_yt: ive tried it about 4 times
ilovecats4606: wtf
theseat_yt: it is
theseat_yt: I honestly started looking at this calculator earlier today lol, took two hours and still dont understand it
ilovecats4606: im testing this to see if its consistent
ilovecats4606: pressing AC will show a line btw near the top of the screen
ilovecats4606: i am still so confused on how SB even works and how this ACE works without eval
ilovecats4606: obtain and enter SpecialBox then [Fraction] 6 times, [right arrow] 4 times, [DEL] 4 times (a symbol will appear to the right of SB), [left arrow], [fraction], [right arrow], [Fraction] 6 times, [right arrow] 4 times, [DEL] 2 times
ilovecats4606: idk if its a hackstring? but just a sequ ig
ilovecats4606: opened the debug menu with a hackstring
ilovecats4606: this guy got ace
kribit: holy peak what did i miss
ilovecats4606: how to dump rom 🙏
theseat_yt: How to get hex/bin/decimal:
Start by clearing the calculator: [shift],[9],[3],[=],[ac]

2. press [√] until you cannot any more (or 13 times)
3. press [=]
4. press [left arrow] 
5. press [DEL] 17 times, or until you have reached the left of the box
6. press [left arrow] 
7. press [DEL] 14 times, or until the box is the only symbol left
8. press [right arrow] 2 times. if the cursor doesn't move on the second press, you have done it correctly.
9. Repeat until the "M" symbol lights up (or ~104 times): press [x10ˣ] then press [Ans]
10. Press [AC] then press left arrow
11. Press [=]
12. Press [AC] and press [fraction]
13. Press [√] then press [Abs] then press [𝒙□]

15. Press [AC]
16. Press [left arrow]
17. Press [DEL] 3 times then press [left arrow] then press [DEL] 2 times.

KEY:
[𝒙²] = decimal
ilovecats4606: sure
theseat_yt: I'll write a tutorial in my style if you like
theseat_yt: i got it!
theseat_yt: ty
ilovecats4606: tutorial
ilovecats4606: get the specialbox (1/1sqrt sqrt) then enter into specialbox and type x10x ans repeatedly in order. The M will light up when you done it enough times, ac left equals. Then if you did it right, it will pause for a sec then error, AC then you entered it. A good way to check if it worked is press FRACTION 3 times
ilovecats4606: wait maybe is the default?
ilovecats4606: i didnt need to enter mathio/matho
theseat_yt: whats that
ilovecats4606: it was in overflow mode or whatever
ilovecats4606: im trying to figure out how i did this
theseat_yt: I managed to do it twice but then I forgot it then re remembered it
theseat_yt: yeah pretty cool lol
ilovecats4606: arbitary code exec
ilovecats4606: you entered that menu without using the default way of enter
theseat_yt: wdym
ilovecats4606: thats crazyyy
ilovecats4606: this guy just did ACE
ilovecats4606: and theres a counter
ilovecats4606: if you answer the question it wont let you enter with 6 until a reset
ilovecats4606: yea hlmfao
ilovecats4606: I saw that. But i never tried it because it was too fast and i some features like constant not on this calc
theseat_yt: ohhhh lmao
ilovecats4606: press 6
theseat_yt: I tried doing shift + 7 + on but it just gave me a maths problem, two numbers on the format of xx/xx and press AC to reset
theseat_yt: https://discord.com/channels/839749858687844372/840391748063592449/1293742752978309120
theseat_yt: I copied a tutorial shown in <#840391748063592449> and played around with them for an hour or so
ilovecats4606: if you could tell me how you got these things that would be great i really want to do trandom stuffs
ilovecats4606: no thats ok bro
theseat_yt: sorry for responding late, I just had dinner lol
theseat_yt: nice
ilovecats4606: I got this
ilovecats4606: sorry for ping, its not the same as the "ERROR" erorr message. Pretty cool tho
ilovecats4606: this one is shift 7 on, but you got it with hackstring
ilovecats4606: <@782395167079792691> how did you find how to do these? i want to know
ilovecats4606: <@895187713261703188>

ilovecats4606: any way to crack emulator and use something like cheat engine to view memory of calc???
ilovecats4606: i really dont remember sorry
ilovecats4606: i press random button
kribit: I remember doing it but forgetting too
kribit: Also the line
kribit: Non his find is major lol
kribit: I Speedrun all errors on the calc at school

kribit: This is literally the best asmr videos I’ve ever watched 🔥
kribit: I forgot to mention that
ilovecats4606: i can get the normal letter by press alpha and then the button

ilovecats4606: https://youtu.be/UMJQcZAYo7c
hoang_phuc1234: idk
ilovecats4606: i made the calculator crash and turn off
ilovecats4606: can you tell exact buttons please
hoang_phuc1234: but that's 1st

hoang_phuc1234: like this
hoang_phuc1234: pop er0
addr
render
ilovecats4606: i saw it but idk the buttons cause too fast
ilovecats4606: wait theres a hackstring to do render dump
hoang_phuc1234: you can dump via render
hoang_phuc1234: like you can't do that on emulator
hoang_phuc1234: but you can't do the real ROP
hoang_phuc1234: yes you can
ilovecats4606: cant we just dump from emulator
ilovecats4606: lemme read the casio forum
ilovecats4606: what rop
hoang_phuc1234: use ROP
ilovecats4606: is there a way to dump rom with this? also, cant we just extract rom from hardware/emulator?
kribit: I know I’ve done it before I’ve just never known how I did it
kribit: Also with corrupt screen glitch try and fine the way to get just a single line through the screen
kribit: But I do know that blank screen is what happened sometimes on first
kribit: Tbh I don’t know, I don’t even know if they work on second
kribit: You can’t just keep saying that😭
hoang_phuc1234: look like sex
hoang_phuc1234: ?
ilovecats4606: no syntax now
ilovecats4606: 
ilovecats4606: Also, i did your corrupt screen, and after pressing equals, i got a weird screen that had like lines and dots, and then syntax
ilovecats4606: <@895187713261703188> what exactly are hackstrings? do they work on 2nd ed? When i use the little a mode 68 thing, it just blank screens
ilovecats4606: yes ik
ilovecats4606: syntax
ilovecats4606: but if you put numbers, it will error
hoang_phuc1234: binary, hexadecimal, decimal
ilovecats4606: yes i know
kribit: But oh well
kribit: It crashes when equals sadly
ilovecats4606: thingy
ilovecats4606: i can switch oct bin hex
ilovecats4606: yo what is htis
kribit: Huh how
ilovecats4606: 
kribit: Switches modes
kribit: Press buttons sqr power log and in
kribit: Ye
ilovecats4606: binary??
ilovecats4606: i got bin
kribit: Can’t exactly remember
kribit: Try pressing left or ac a bunch
ilovecats4606: how do you get the one that says hex 0000000000
kribit: That’s were I asked my questions cause this channel didn’t exist I think
kribit: But some works
ilovecats4606: thats for the non 2nd

kribit: This server
ilovecats4606: where?
kribit: Other people taught me most of it but I edified it and made it easiest to do
ilovecats4606: intersted in how you find out these things
kribit: Then ac left or smth
ilovecats4606: ok
kribit: Then fraction abs sqrt sqr
ilovecats4606: (in your big wall of text)
ilovecats4606: the first one?
kribit: Do corrupt screen glitch
ilovecats4606: how to do that
ilovecats4606: when i type little and and enter, it will show a blank screen
ilovecats4606: i followed the instructions of non 2nd edition, and i can get into submode 0 stat thingy
hoang_phuc1234: i dont have the calculator
hoang_phuc1234: idk
ilovecats4606: i want to type "CATS"
ilovecats4606: how to?

ilovecats4606: nvm im dumb, button below sqroot
ilovecats4606: what is sqrdeg
ilovecats4606: not a lot for this calc

hoang_phuc1234: cool
omega314: I found this cool glitch, it probably already exists:

In COMP mode MathIO if you type a division of two numbers followed by lots of left brackets until you cannot type any more and press "=", you will get a stack error. Now press the left button and your cursor is stuck!

For example:

`3÷2((((((((((((((((((((((((((` [=] [left button]

Results in `|3÷ 2` where the pipe is the stuck cursor and there is a significant gap between the division sign and the 2.
neoroll: Same
